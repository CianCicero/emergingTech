# Trigram Model & ELIZA Chatbot
## Cian Mc Cann

## Overview:
This project centers around the concept of parsing human language and using different techniques to replicate it. <br>
<br> 
 **The Trigram Model** notepad offers a line by line explanination of how to capture patterns found in human language, creating a model, and then analyzing it's effectiveness. <br><br>
**The ELIZA Chatbot** application offers a user-friendly GUI through which you can converse with a chatbot. While conversing, you can look through the code for explanations of the responses.<br> <br>
**The Comments** for both elements aim to give precise insight into how each process works. However, the Notebook's comments focus on explaining every single operation taking place, while the ELIZA Chatbot's comments contain a large breakdown demonstrating the logical flow of the program (see ladder visualization - line 150) along with more precise explaninations for individual functionalities.



## Trigram Model

### Installation:
The Trigram Model can be developed and run using a variety of IDEs that support Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

#### IDEs that support Jupyter Notebooks:
- **VS Code**: Ensure the Python extension is installed along with the Jupyter extension.
- **PyCharm**: Professional edition includes support for Jupyter Notebooks.
- **JupyterLab**: A web-based IDE specifically for running Jupyter Notebooks.

### Python:
To install Python, visit the [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version for your operating system.

1. Download and install Python.
2. Ensure Python is added to your systemâ€™s `PATH` environment variable.

### Jupyter Notebook:
To install Jupyter Notebooks, you can use Python's package manager `pip`. First, install `pip` if it's not already installed, then install Jupyter.

 Install Jupyter by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```

### Cloning:
 **To clone the repo, first install Git:**
 [Official Git Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads)<br>
 **Then open your terminal and run the following:** 
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/CianCicero/emergingTech.git
 ```
### Open the project in your preferred IDE. <br> Use the pre-set books or import your own **(Import them into the data directory in the project)** 

### Make sure to run the cells order from top down.

## ELIZA ChatBot

### Installation
#### Installation of the Eliza bot is not necessary as it is deployed via GitHub Pages

Just follow [This link](https://ciancicero.github.io/emergingTech/)
#### It uses several techniques (such as reflection, pattern-matching and keyword recognition) to respond to user messages. 

After talking to the ELIZA ChatBot, I suggest looking through the eliza.js file to understand how it works.

## References can be found for both elements, at the end of their respective source code.
