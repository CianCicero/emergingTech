ZARATHUSTRA IS MY BROTHERS MOST PERSONAL WORK IT IS THE HISTORY OFHIS MOST INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES OF HIS FRIENDSHIPS IDEALS RAPTURESBITTEREST DISAPPOINTMENTS AND SORROWS. ABOVE IT ALL HOWEVER THERESOARS TRANSFIGURING IT THE IMAGE OF HIS GREATEST HOPES AND REMOTESTAIMS. MY BROTHER HAD THE FIGURE OF ZARATHUSTRA IN HIS MIND FROM HIS VERYEARLIEST YOUTH HE ONCE TOLD ME THAT EVEN AS A CHILD HE HAD DREAMT OFHIM. AT DIFFERENT PERIODS IN HIS LIFE HE WOULD CALL THIS HAUNTER OF HISDREAMS BY DIFFERENT NAMES BUT IN THE END HE DECLARES IN A NOTE ONTHE SUBJECT I HAD TO DO A PERSIAN THE HONOUR OF IDENTIFYING HIM WITHTHIS CREATURE OF MY FANCY. PERSIANS WERE THE FIRST TO TAKE A BROAD ANDCOMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF HISTORY. EVERY SERIES OF EVOLUTIONS ACCORDINGTO THEM WAS PRESIDED OVER BY A PROPHET AND EVERY PROPHET HAD HISHAZARHIS DYNASTY OF A THOUSAND YEARS.ALL ZARATHUSTRAS VIEWS AS ALSO HIS PERSONALITY WERE EARLY CONCEPTIONSOF MY BROTHERS MIND. WHOEVER READS HIS POSTHUMOUSLY PUBLISHED WRITINGSFOR THE YEARS WITH CARE WILL CONSTANTLY MEET WITH PASSAGESSUGGESTIVE OF ZARATHUSTRAS THOUGHTS AND DOCTRINES. FOR INSTANCE THEIDEAL OF THE SUPERMAN IS PUT FORTH QUITE CLEARLY IN ALL HIS WRITINGSDURING THE YEARS AND IN WE PHILOLOGISTS THE FOLLOWINGREMARKABLE OBSERVATIONS OCCURHOW CAN ONE PRAISE AND GLORIFY A NATION AS A WHOLEEVEN AMONG THEGREEKS IT WAS THE INDIVIDUALS THAT COUNTED.THE GREEKS ARE INTERESTING AND EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY REAREDSUCH A VAST NUMBER OF GREAT INDIVIDUALS. HOW WAS THIS POSSIBLE THEQUESTION IS ONE WHICH OUGHT TO BE STUDIED.I AM INTERESTED ONLY IN THE RELATIONS OF A PEOPLE TO THE REARING OFTHE INDIVIDUAL MAN AND AMONG THE GREEKS THE CONDITIONS WERE UNUSUALLYFAVOURABLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL NOT BY ANY MEANS OWINGTO THE GOODNESS OF THE PEOPLE BUT BECAUSE OF THE STRUGGLES OF THEIREVIL INSTINCTS.WITH THE HELP OF FAVOURABLE MEASURES GREAT INDIVIDUALS MIGHT BE REAREDWHO WOULD BE BOTH DIFFERENT FROM AND HIGHER THAN THOSE WHO HERETOFOREHAVE OWED THEIR EXISTENCE TO MERE CHANCE. HERE WE MAY STILL BE HOPEFULIN THE REARING OF EXCEPTIONAL MEN.THE NOTION OF REARING THE SUPERMAN IS ONLY A NEW FORM OF AN IDEALNIETZSCHE ALREADY HAD IN HIS YOUTH THAT THE OBJECT OF MANKIND SHOULDLIE IN ITS HIGHEST INDIVIDUALS OR AS HE WRITES IN SCHOPENHAUER ASEDUCATOR MANKIND OUGHT CONSTANTLY TO BE STRIVING TO PRODUCE GREATMENTHIS AND NOTHING ELSE IS ITS DUTY. BUT THE IDEALS HE MOST REVEREDIN THOSE DAYS ARE NO LONGER HELD TO BE THE HIGHEST TYPES OF MEN. NOAROUND THIS FUTURE IDEAL OF A COMING HUMANITYTHE SUPERMANTHE POETSPREAD THE VEIL OF BECOMING. WHO CAN TELL TO WHAT GLORIOUS HEIGHTS MANCAN STILL ASCEND THAT IS WHY AFTER HAVING TESTED THE WORTH OF OURNOBLEST IDEALTHAT OF THE SAVIOUR IN THE LIGHT OF THE NEW VALUATIONSTHE POET CRIES WITH PASSIONATE EMPHASIS IN ZARATHUSTRANEVER YET HATH THERE BEEN A SUPERMAN. NAKED HAVE I SEEN BOTH OF THEMTHE GREATEST AND THE SMALLEST MANALLTOOSIMILAR ARE THEY STILL TO EACH OTHER. VERILY EVEN THE GREATESTFOUND IALLTOOHUMANTHE PHRASE THE REARING OF THE SUPERMAN HAS VERY OFTEN BEENMISUNDERSTOOD. BY THE WORD REARING IN THIS CASE IS MEANT THE ACT OFMODIFYING BY MEANS OF NEW AND HIGHER VALUESVALUES WHICH AS LAWS ANDGUIDES OF CONDUCT AND OPINION ARE NOW TO RULE OVER MANKIND. IN GENERALTHE DOCTRINE OF THE SUPERMAN CAN ONLY BE UNDERSTOOD CORRECTLY INCONJUNCTION WITH OTHER IDEAS OF THE AUTHORS SUCH ASTHE ORDEROF RANK THE WILL TO POWER AND THE TRANSVALUATION OF ALL VALUES. HEASSUMES THAT CHRISTIANITY AS A PRODUCT OF THE RESENTMENT OF THE BOTCHEDAND THE WEAK HAS PUT IN BAN ALL THAT IS BEAUTIFUL STRONG PROUD ANDPOWERFUL IN FACT ALL THE QUALITIES RESULTING FROM STRENGTH AND THATIN CONSEQUENCE ALL FORCES WHICH TEND TO PROMOTE OR ELEVATE LIFE HAVEBEEN SERIOUSLY UNDERMINED. NOW HOWEVER A NEW TABLE OF VALUATIONSMUST BE PLACED OVER MANKINDNAMELY THAT OF THE STRONG MIGHTY ANDMAGNIFICENT MAN OVERFLOWING WITH LIFE AND ELEVATED TO HIS ZENITHTHESUPERMAN WHO IS NOW PUT BEFORE US WITH OVERPOWERING PASSION AS THEAIM OF OUR LIFE HOPE AND WILL. AND JUST AS THE OLD SYSTEM OF VALUINGWHICH ONLY EXTOLLED THE QUALITIES FAVOURABLE TO THE WEAK THE SUFFERINGAND THE OPPRESSED HAS SUCCEEDED IN PRODUCING A WEAK SUFFERING ANDMODERN RACE SO THIS NEW AND REVERSED SYSTEM OF VALUING OUGHT TO REARA HEALTHY STRONG LIVELY AND COURAGEOUS TYPE WHICH WOULD BE A GLORYTO LIFE ITSELF. STATED BRIEFLY THE LEADING PRINCIPLE OF THIS NEW SYSTEMOF VALUING WOULD BE ALL THAT PROCEEDS FROM POWER IS GOOD ALL THATSPRINGS FROM WEAKNESS IS BAD.THIS TYPE MUST NOT BE REGARDED AS A FANCIFUL FIGURE IT IS NOT ANEBULOUS HOPE WHICH IS TO BE REALISED AT SOME INDEFINITELY REMOTEPERIOD THOUSANDS OF YEARS HENCE NOR IS IT A NEW SPECIES IN THEDARWINIAN SENSE OF WHICH WE CAN KNOW NOTHING AND WHICH IT WOULDTHEREFORE BE SOMEWHAT ABSURD TO STRIVE AFTER. BUT IT IS MEANT TO BEA POSSIBILITY WHICH MEN OF THE PRESENT COULD REALISE WITH ALL THEIRSPIRITUAL AND PHYSICAL ENERGIES PROVIDED THEY ADOPTED THE NEW VALUES.THE AUTHOR OF ZARATHUSTRA NEVER LOST SIGHT OF THAT EGREGIOUS EXAMPLEOF A TRANSVALUATION OF ALL VALUES THROUGH CHRISTIANITY WHEREBY THEWHOLE OF THE DEIFIED MODE OF LIFE AND THOUGHT OF THE GREEKS AS WELL ASSTRONG ROMEDOM WAS ALMOST ANNIHILATED OR TRANSVALUED IN A COMPARATIVELYSHORT TIME. COULD NOT A REJUVENATED GRAECOROMAN SYSTEM OF VALUING ONCEIT HAD BEEN REFINED AND MADE MORE PROFOUND BY THE SCHOOLING WHICHTWO THOUSAND YEARS OF CHRISTIANITY HAD PROVIDED EFFECT ANOTHER SUCHREVOLUTION WITHIN A CALCULABLE PERIOD OF TIME UNTIL THAT GLORIOUS TYPEOF MANHOOD SHALL FINALLY APPEAR WHICH IS TO BE OUR NEW FAITH AND HOPEAND IN THE CREATION OF WHICH ZARATHUSTRA EXHORTS US TO PARTICIPATEIN HIS PRIVATE NOTES ON THE SUBJECT THE AUTHOR USES THE EXPRESSIONSUPERMAN ALWAYS IN THE SINGULAR BYTHEBYE AS SIGNIFYING THE MOSTTHOROUGHLY WELLCONSTITUTED TYPE AS OPPOSED TO MODERN MAN ABOVEALL HOWEVER HE DESIGNATES ZARATHUSTRA HIMSELF AS AN EXAMPLE OF THESUPERMAN. IN ECCO HOMO HE IS CAREFUL TO ENLIGHTEN US CONCERNING THEPRECURSORS AND PREREQUISITES TO THE ADVENT OF THIS HIGHEST TYPE INREFERRING TO A CERTAIN PASSAGE IN THE GAY SCIENCEIN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THIS TYPE WE MUST FIRST BE QUITE CLEAR INREGARD TO THE LEADING PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITION ON WHICH IT DEPENDS THISCONDITION IS WHAT I CALL GREAT HEALTHINESS. I KNOW NOT HOW TO EXPRESS MYMEANING MORE PLAINLY OR MORE PERSONALLY THAN I HAVE DONE ALREADY INONE OF THE LAST CHAPTERS APHORISM OF THE FIFTH BOOK OF THE GAYASCIENZA.WE THE NEW THE NAMELESS THE HARDTOUNDERSTANDIT SAYSTHEREWE FIRSTLINGS OF A YET UNTRIED FUTUREWE REQUIRE FOR A NEW ENDALSO A NEW MEANS NAMELY A NEW HEALTHINESS STRONGER SHARPER TOUGHERBOLDER AND MERRIER THAN ALL HEALTHINESS HITHERTO.

IN REGARD TO HISFIRST CONCEPTION OF THIS IDEA HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH ECCE HOMOWRITTEN IN THE AUTUMN OF CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING PASSAGETHE FUNDAMENTAL IDEA OF MY WORKNAMELY THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE OFALL THINGSTHIS HIGHEST OF ALL POSSIBLE FORMULAE OF A YEASAYINGPHILOSOPHY FIRST OCCURRED TO ME IN AUGUST . I MADE A NOTE OF THETHOUGHT ON A SHEET OF PAPER WITH THE POSTSCRIPT FEET BEYONDMEN AND TIME THAT DAY I HAPPENED TO BE WANDERING THROUGH THE WOODSALONGSIDE OF THE LAKE OF SILVAPLANA AND I HALTED BESIDE A HUGEPYRAMIDAL AND TOWERING ROCK NOT FAR FROM SURLEI. IT WAS THEN THAT THETHOUGHT STRUCK ME. LOOKING BACK NOW I FIND THAT EXACTLY TWO MONTHSPREVIOUS TO THIS INSPIRATION I HAD HAD AN OMEN OF ITS COMING IN THEFORM OF A SUDDEN AND DECISIVE ALTERATION IN MY TASTESMORE PARTICULARLYIN MUSIC. IT WOULD EVEN BE POSSIBLE TO CONSIDER ALL ZARATHUSTRA AS AMUSICAL COMPOSITION. AT ALL EVENTS A VERY NECESSARY CONDITION IN ITSPRODUCTION WAS A RENAISSANCE IN MYSELF OF THE ART OF HEARING. IN A SMALLMOUNTAIN RESORT RECOARO NEAR VICENZA WHERE I SPENT THE SPRING OF I AND MY FRIEND AND MAESTRO PETER GASTALSO ONE WHO HAD BEENBORN AGAINDISCOVERED THAT THE PHOENIX MUSIC THAT HOVERED OVER US WORELIGHTER AND BRIGHTER PLUMES THAN IT HAD DONE THERETOFORE.DURING THE MONTH OF AUGUST MY BROTHER RESOLVED TO REVEAL THETEACHING OF THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE IN DITHYRAMBIC AND PSALMODIC FORMTHROUGH THE MOUTH OF ZARATHUSTRA. AMONG THE NOTES OF THIS PERIOD WEFOUND A PAGE ON WHICH IS WRITTEN THE FIRST DEFINITE PLAN OF THUS SPAKEZARATHUSTRAMIDDAY AND ETERNITY.GUIDEPOSTS TO A NEW WAY OF LIVING.BENEATH THIS IS WRITTENZARATHUSTRA BORN ON LAKE URMI LEFT HIS HOME IN HIS THIRTIETH YEARWENT INTO THE PROVINCE OF ARIA AND DURING TEN YEARS OF SOLITUDE IN THEMOUNTAINS COMPOSED THE ZENDAVESTA.THE SUN OF KNOWLEDGE STANDS ONCE MORE AT MIDDAY AND THE SERPENTOF ETERNITY LIES COILED IN ITS LIGHT IT IS YOUR TIME YE MIDDAYBRETHREN.IN THAT SUMMER OF MY BROTHER AFTER MANY YEARS OF STEADILYDECLINING HEALTH BEGAN AT LAST TO RALLY AND IT IS TO THIS FIRST GUSHOF THE RECOVERY OF HIS ONCE SPLENDID BODILY CONDITION THAT WE OWE NOTONLY THE GAY SCIENCE WHICH IN ITS MOOD MAY BE REGARDED AS A PRELUDETO ZARATHUSTRA BUT ALSO ZARATHUSTRA ITSELF. JUST AS HE WASBEGINNING TO RECUPERATE HIS HEALTH HOWEVER AN UNKIND DESTINY BROUGHTHIM A NUMBER OF MOST PAINFUL PERSONAL EXPERIENCES. HIS FRIENDS CAUSEDHIM MANY DISAPPOINTMENTS WHICH WERE THE MORE BITTER TO HIM INASMUCH ASHE REGARDED FRIENDSHIP AS SUCH A SACRED INSTITUTION AND FOR THE FIRSTTIME IN HIS LIFE HE REALISED THE WHOLE HORROR OF THAT LONELINESS TOWHICH PERHAPS ALL GREATNESS IS CONDEMNED. BUT TO BE FORSAKEN ISSOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT FROM DELIBERATELY CHOOSING BLESSED LONELINESS.HOW HE LONGED IN THOSE DAYS FOR THE IDEAL FRIEND WHO WOULD THOROUGHLYUNDERSTAND HIM TO WHOM HE WOULD BE ABLE TO SAY ALL AND WHOM HEIMAGINED HE HAD FOUND AT VARIOUS PERIODS IN HIS LIFE FROM HIS EARLIESTYOUTH ONWARDS. NOW HOWEVER THAT THE WAY HE HAD CHOSEN GREW EVER MOREPERILOUS AND STEEP HE FOUND NOBODY WHO COULD FOLLOW HIM HE THEREFORECREATED A PERFECT FRIEND FOR HIMSELF IN THE IDEAL FORM OF A MAJESTICPHILOSOPHER AND MADE THIS CREATION THE PREACHER OF HIS GOSPEL TO THEWORLD.WHETHER MY BROTHER WOULD EVER HAVE WRITTEN THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA ACCORDING TO THE FIRST PLAN SKETCHED IN THE SUMMER OF IF HEHAD NOT HAD THE DISAPPOINTMENTS ALREADY REFERRED TO IS NOW AN IDLEQUESTION BUT PERHAPS WHERE ZARATHUSTRA IS CONCERNED WE MAY ALSO SAYWITH MASTER ECKHARDT THE FLEETEST BEAST TO BEAR YOU TO PERFECTION ISSUFFERING.MY BROTHER WRITES AS FOLLOWS ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF THE FIRST PART OFZARATHUSTRAIN THE WINTER OF I WAS LIVING ON THE CHARMINGLITTLE GULF OF RAPALLO NOT FAR FROM GENOA AND BETWEEN CHIAVARI ANDCAPE PORTO FINO. MY HEALTH WAS NOT VERY GOOD THE WINTER WAS COLD ANDEXCEPTIONALLY RAINY AND THE SMALL INN IN WHICH I LIVED WAS SO CLOSETO THE WATER THAT AT NIGHT MY SLEEP WOULD BE DISTURBED IF THE SEA WEREHIGH. THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE SURELY THE VERY REVERSE OF FAVOURABLEAND YET IN SPITE OF IT ALL AND AS IF IN DEMONSTRATION OF MY BELIEF THATEVERYTHING DECISIVE COMES TO LIFE IN SPITE OF EVERY OBSTACLE IT WASPRECISELY DURING THIS WINTER AND IN THE MIDST OF THESE UNFAVOURABLECIRCUMSTANCES THAT MY ZARATHUSTRA ORIGINATED. IN THE MORNING I USED TOSTART OUT IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION UP THE GLORIOUS ROAD TO ZOAGLI WHICHRISES ALOFT THROUGH A FOREST OF PINES AND GIVES ONE A VIEW FAR OUT INTOTHE SEA. IN THE AFTERNOON AS OFTEN AS MY HEALTH PERMITTED I WALKEDROUND THE WHOLE BAY FROM SANTA MARGHERITA TO BEYOND PORTO FINO. THISSPOT WAS ALL THE MORE INTERESTING TO ME INASMUCH AS IT WAS SO DEARLYLOVED BY THE EMPEROR FREDERICK III. IN THE AUTUMN OF I CHANCED TOBE THERE AGAIN WHEN HE WAS REVISITING THIS SMALL FORGOTTEN WORLDOF HAPPINESS FOR THE LAST TIME. IT WAS ON THESE TWO ROADS THAT ALLZARATHUSTRA CAME TO ME ABOVE ALL ZARATHUSTRA HIMSELF AS A TYPEIOUGHT RATHER TO SAY THAT IT WAS ON THESE WALKS THAT THESE IDEAS WAYLAIDME.THE FIRST PART OF ZARATHUSTRA WAS WRITTEN IN ABOUT TEN DAYSTHAT ISTO SAY FROM THE BEGINNING TO ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF FEBRUARY . THELAST LINES WERE WRITTEN PRECISELY IN THE HALLOWED HOUR WHEN RICHARDWAGNER GAVE UP THE GHOST IN VENICE.WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE TEN DAYS OCCUPIED IN COMPOSING THE FIRST PARTOF THIS BOOK MY BROTHER OFTEN REFERRED TO THIS WINTER AS THE HARDESTAND SICKLIEST HE HAD EVER EXPERIENCED. HE DID NOT HOWEVER MEAN THEREBYTHAT HIS FORMER DISORDERS WERE TROUBLING HIM BUT THAT HE WAS SUFFERINGFROM A SEVERE ATTACK OF INFLUENZA WHICH HE HAD CAUGHT IN SANTAMARGHERITA AND WHICH TORMENTED HIM FOR SEVERAL WEEKS AFTER HIS ARRIVALIN GENOA. AS A MATTER OF FACT HOWEVER WHAT HE COMPLAINED OF MOST WASHIS SPIRITUAL CONDITIONTHAT INDESCRIBABLE FORSAKENNESSTO WHICH HEGIVES SUCH HEARTRENDING EXPRESSION IN ZARATHUSTRA. EVEN THE RECEPTIONWHICH THE FIRST PART MET WITH AT THE HANDS OF FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCESWAS EXTREMELY DISHEARTENING FOR ALMOST ALL THOSE TO WHOM HE PRESENTEDCOPIES OF THE WORK MISUNDERSTOOD IT. I FOUND NO ONE RIPE FOR MANY OF MYTHOUGHTS THE CASE OF ZARATHUSTRA PROVES THAT ONE CAN SPEAK WITH THEUTMOST CLEARNESS AND YET NOT BE HEARD BY ANY ONE. MY BROTHER WAS VERYMUCH DISCOURAGED BY THE FEEBLENESS OF THE RESPONSE HE WAS GIVEN AND ASHE WAS STRIVING JUST THEN TO GIVE UP THE PRACTICE OF TAKING HYDRATEOF CHLORALA DRUG HE HAD BEGUN TO TAKE WHILE ILL WITH INFLUENZATHEFOLLOWING SPRING SPENT IN ROME WAS A SOMEWHAT GLOOMY ONE FOR HIM.HE WRITES ABOUT IT AS FOLLOWSI SPENT A MELANCHOLY SPRING IN ROMEWHERE I ONLY JUST MANAGED TO LIVEAND THIS WAS NO EASY MATTER. THISCITY WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY UNSUITED TO THE POETAUTHOR OF ZARATHUSTRAAND FOR THE CHOICE OF WHICH I WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE MADE ME INORDINATELYMISERABLE. I TRIED TO LEAVE IT. I WANTED TO GO TO AQUILATHE OPPOSITEOF ROME IN EVERY RESPECT AND ACTUALLY FOUNDED IN A SPIRIT OF ENMITYTOWARDS THAT CITY JUST AS I ALSO SHALL FOUND A CITY SOME DAY AS AMEMENTO OF AN ATHEIST AND GENUINE ENEMY OF THE CHURCHA PERSON VERYCLOSELY RELATED TO METHE GREAT HOHENSTAUFEN THE EMPEROR FREDERICKII. BUT FATE LAY BEHIND IT ALL I HAD TO RETURN AGAIN TO ROME. IN THEEND I WAS OBLIGED TO BE SATISFIED WITH THE PIAZZA BARBERINI AFTER I HADEXERTED MYSELF IN VAIN TO FIND AN ANTICHRISTIAN QUARTER. I FEAR THATON ONE OCCASION TO AVOID BAD SMELLS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE I ACTUALLYINQUIRED AT THE PALAZZO DEL QUIRINALE WHETHER THEY COULD NOT PROVIDE AQUIET ROOM FOR A PHILOSOPHER. IN A CHAMBER HIGH ABOVE THE PIAZZA JUSTMENTIONED FROM WHICH ONE OBTAINED A GENERAL VIEW OF ROME AND COULDHEAR THE FOUNTAINS PLASHING FAR BELOW THE LONELIEST OF ALL SONGSWAS COMPOSEDTHE NIGHTSONG. ABOUT THIS TIME I WAS OBSESSED BY ANUNSPEAKABLY SAD MELODY THE REFRAIN OF WHICH I RECOGNISED IN THE WORDSDEAD THROUGH IMMORTALITY.WE REMAINED SOMEWHAT TOO LONG IN ROME THAT SPRING AND WHAT WITH THEEFFECT OF THE INCREASING HEAT AND THE DISCOURAGING CIRCUMSTANCES ALREADYDESCRIBED MY BROTHER RESOLVED NOT TO WRITE ANY MORE OR IN ANY CASENOT TO PROCEED WITH ZARATHUSTRA ALTHOUGH I OFFERED TO RELIEVE HIMOF ALL TROUBLE IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROOFS AND THE PUBLISHER. WHENHOWEVER WE RETURNED TO SWITZERLAND TOWARDS THE END OF JUNE AND HEFOUND HIMSELF ONCE MORE IN THE FAMILIAR AND EXHILARATING AIR OF THEMOUNTAINS ALL HIS JOYOUS CREATIVE POWERS REVIVED AND IN A NOTE TO MEANNOUNCING THE DISPATCH OF SOME MANUSCRIPT HE WROTE AS FOLLOWS I HAVEENGAGED A PLACE HERE FOR THREE MONTHS FORSOOTH I AM THE GREATEST FOOLTO ALLOW MY COURAGE TO BE SAPPED FROM ME BY THE CLIMATE OF ITALY. NOWAND AGAIN I AM TROUBLED BY THE THOUGHT WHAT NEXT MY FUTURE IS THEDARKEST THING IN THE WORLD TO ME BUT AS THERE STILL REMAINS A GREATDEAL FOR ME TO DO I SUPPOSE I OUGHT RATHER TO THINK OF DOING THIS THANOF MY FUTURE AND LEAVE THE REST TO THEE AND THE GODS.THE SECOND PART OF ZARATHUSTRA WAS WRITTEN BETWEEN THE TH OF JUNEAND THE TH JULY. THIS SUMMER FINDING MYSELF ONCE MORE IN THE SACREDPLACE WHERE THE FIRST THOUGHT OF ZARATHUSTRA FLASHED ACROSS MY MINDI CONCEIVED THE SECOND PART. TEN DAYS SUFFICED. NEITHER FOR THE SECONDTHE FIRST NOR THE THIRD PART HAVE I REQUIRED A DAY LONGER.HE OFTEN USED TO SPEAK OF THE ECSTATIC MOOD IN WHICH HE WROTEZARATHUSTRA HOW IN HIS WALKS OVER HILL AND DALE THE IDEAS WOULD CROWDINTO HIS MIND AND HOW HE WOULD NOTE THEM DOWN HASTILY IN A NOTEBOOKFROM WHICH HE WOULD TRANSCRIBE THEM ON HIS RETURN SOMETIMES WORKINGTILL MIDNIGHT. HE SAYS IN A LETTER TO ME YOU CAN HAVE NO IDEA OF THEVEHEMENCE OF SUCH COMPOSITION AND IN ECCE HOMO AUTUMN HEDESCRIBES AS FOLLOWS WITH PASSIONATE ENTHUSIASM THE INCOMPARABLE MOOD INWHICH HE CREATED ZARATHUSTRAHAS ANY ONE AT THE END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY ANY DISTINCT NOTIONOF WHAT POETS OF A STRONGER AGE UNDERSTOOD BY THE WORD INSPIRATION IFNOT I WILL DESCRIBE IT. IF ONE HAD THE SMALLEST VESTIGE OF SUPERSTITIONIN ONE IT WOULD HARDLY BE POSSIBLE TO SET ASIDE COMPLETELY THE IDEATHAT ONE IS THE MERE INCARNATION MOUTHPIECE OR MEDIUM OF AN ALMIGHTYPOWER. THE IDEA OF REVELATION IN THE SENSE THAT SOMETHING BECOMESSUDDENLY VISIBLE AND AUDIBLE WITH INDESCRIBABLE CERTAINTY AND ACCURACYWHICH PROFOUNDLY CONVULSES AND UPSETS ONEDESCRIBES SIMPLY THE MATTEROF FACT. ONE HEARSONE DOES NOT SEEK ONE TAKESONE DOES NOT ASKWHO GIVES A THOUGHT SUDDENLY FLASHES UP LIKE LIGHTNING IT COMES WITHNECESSITY UNHESITATINGLYI HAVE NEVER HAD ANY CHOICE IN THE MATTER.THERE IS AN ECSTASY SUCH THAT THE IMMENSE STRAIN OF IT IS SOMETIMESRELAXED BY A FLOOD OF TEARS ALONG WITH WHICH ONES STEPS EITHER RUSHOR INVOLUNTARILY LAG ALTERNATELY. THERE IS THE FEELING THAT ONE ISCOMPLETELY OUT OF HAND WITH THE VERY DISTINCT CONSCIOUSNESS OF ANENDLESS NUMBER OF FINE THRILLS AND QUIVERINGS TO THE VERY TOESTHEREIS A DEPTH OF HAPPINESS IN WHICH THE PAINFULLEST AND GLOOMIEST DO NOTOPERATE AS ANTITHESES BUT AS CONDITIONED AS DEMANDED IN THE SENSE OFNECESSARY SHADES OF COLOUR IN SUCH AN OVERFLOW OF LIGHT. THERE IS ANINSTINCT FOR RHYTHMIC RELATIONS WHICH EMBRACES WIDE AREAS OF FORMSLENGTH THE NEED OF A WIDEEMBRACING RHYTHM IS ALMOST THE MEASURE OFTHE FORCE OF AN INSPIRATION A SORT OF COUNTERPART TO ITS PRESSURE ANDTENSION. EVERYTHING HAPPENS QUITE INVOLUNTARILY AS IF IN A TEMPESTUOUSOUTBURST OF FREEDOM OF ABSOLUTENESS OF POWER AND DIVINITY. THEINVOLUNTARINESS OF THE FIGURES AND SIMILES IS THE MOST REMARKABLETHING ONE LOSES ALL PERCEPTION OF WHAT CONSTITUTES THE FIGURE ANDWHAT CONSTITUTES THE SIMILE EVERYTHING SEEMS TO PRESENT ITSELF ASTHE READIEST THE CORRECTEST AND THE SIMPLEST MEANS OF EXPRESSION.IT ACTUALLY SEEMS TO USE ONE OF ZARATHUSTRAS OWN PHRASES AS IF ALLTHINGS CAME UNTO ONE AND WOULD FAIN BE SIMILES HERE DO ALL THINGSCOME CARESSINGLY TO THY TALK AND FLATTER THEE FOR THEY WANT TO RIDEUPON THY BACK. ON EVERY SIMILE DOST THOU HERE RIDE TO EVERY TRUTH. HEREFLY OPEN UNTO THEE ALL BEINGS WORDS AND WORDCABINETS HERE ALL BEINGWANTETH TO BECOME WORDS HERE ALL BECOMING WANTETH TO LEARN OF THEE HOWTO TALK. THIS IS MY EXPERIENCE OF INSPIRATION. I DO NOT DOUBT BUT THATONE WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK THOUSANDS OF YEARS IN ORDER TO FIND SOME ONEWHO COULD SAY TO ME IT IS MINE ALSOIN THE AUTUMN OF MY BROTHER LEFT THE ENGADINE FOR GERMANY ANDSTAYED THERE A FEW WEEKS. IN THE FOLLOWING WINTER AFTER WANDERINGSOMEWHAT ERRATICALLY THROUGH STRESA GENOA AND SPEZIA HE LANDED INNICE WHERE THE CLIMATE SO HAPPILY PROMOTED HIS CREATIVE POWERS THATHE WROTE THE THIRD PART OF ZARATHUSTRA. IN THE WINTER BENEATH THEHALCYON SKY OF NICE WHICH THEN LOOKED DOWN UPON ME FOR THE FIRST TIMEIN MY LIFE I FOUND THE THIRD ZARATHUSTRAAND CAME TO THE END OF MYTASK THE WHOLE HAVING OCCUPIED ME SCARCELY A YEAR. MANY HIDDEN CORNERSAND HEIGHTS IN THE LANDSCAPES ROUND ABOUT NICE ARE HALLOWED TO ME BYUNFORGETTABLE MOMENTS. THAT DECISIVE CHAPTER ENTITLED OLD AND NEWTABLES WAS COMPOSED IN THE VERY DIFFICULT ASCENT FROM THE STATIONTO EZATHAT WONDERFUL MOORISH VILLAGE IN THE ROCKS. MY MOST CREATIVEMOMENTS WERE ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED BY UNUSUAL MUSCULAR ACTIVITY. THE BODYIS INSPIRED LET US WAIVE THE QUESTION OF THE SOUL. I MIGHT OFTEN HAVEBEEN SEEN DANCING IN THOSE DAYS. WITHOUT A SUGGESTION OF FATIGUE I COULDTHEN WALK FOR SEVEN OR EIGHT HOURS ON END AMONG THE HILLS. I SLEPT WELLAND LAUGHED WELLI WAS PERFECTLY ROBUST AND PATIENT.AS WE HAVE SEEN EACH OF THE THREE PARTS OF ZARATHUSTRA WAS WRITTENAFTER A MORE OR LESS SHORT PERIOD OF PREPARATION IN ABOUT TEN DAYS.THE COMPOSITION OF THE FOURTH PART ALONE WAS BROKEN BY OCCASIONALINTERRUPTIONS. THE FIRST NOTES RELATING TO THIS PART WERE WRITTEN WHILEHE AND I WERE STAYING TOGETHER IN ZURICH IN SEPTEMBER . IN THEFOLLOWING NOVEMBER WHILE STAYING AT MENTONE HE BEGAN TO ELABORATETHESE NOTES AND AFTER A LONG PAUSE FINISHED THE MANUSCRIPT AT NICEBETWEEN THE END OF JANUARY AND THE MIDDLE OF FEBRUARY . MY BROTHERTHEN CALLED THIS PART THE FOURTH AND LAST BUT EVEN BEFORE AND SHORTLYAFTER IT HAD BEEN PRIVATELY PRINTED HE WROTE TO ME SAYING THAT HE STILLINTENDED WRITING A FIFTH AND SIXTH PART AND NOTES RELATING TO THESEPARTS ARE NOW IN MY POSSESSION. THIS FOURTH PART THE ORIGINAL MS. OFWHICH CONTAINS THIS NOTE ONLY FOR MY FRIENDS NOT FOR THE PUBLICIS WRITTEN IN A PARTICULARLY PERSONAL SPIRIT AND THOSE FEW TO WHOM HEPRESENTED A COPY OF IT HE PLEDGED TO THE STRICTEST SECRECY CONCERNINGITS CONTENTS. HE OFTEN THOUGHT OF MAKING THIS FOURTH PART PUBLIC ALSOBUT DOUBTED WHETHER HE WOULD EVER BE ABLE TO DO SO WITHOUT CONSIDERABLYALTERING CERTAIN PORTIONS OF IT. AT ALL EVENTS HE RESOLVED TO DISTRIBUTETHIS MANUSCRIPT PRODUCTION OF WHICH ONLY FORTY COPIES WERE PRINTEDONLY AMONG THOSE WHO HAD PROVED THEMSELVES WORTHY OF IT AND IT SPEAKSELOQUENTLY OF HIS UTTER LONELINESS AND NEED OF SYMPATHY IN THOSE DAYSTHAT HE HAD OCCASION TO PRESENT ONLY SEVEN COPIES OF HIS BOOK ACCORDINGTO THIS RESOLUTION.ALREADY AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS HISTORY I HINTED AT THE REASONS WHICHLED MY BROTHER TO SELECT A PERSIAN AS THE INCARNATION OF HIS IDEAL OFTHE MAJESTIC PHILOSOPHER. HIS REASONS HOWEVER FOR CHOOSING ZARATHUSTRAOF ALL OTHERS TO BE HIS MOUTHPIECE HE GIVES US IN THE FOLLOWINGWORDSPEOPLE HAVE NEVER ASKED ME AS THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE WHAT THENAME ZARATHUSTRA PRECISELY MEANS IN MY MOUTH IN THE MOUTH OF THE FIRSTIMMORALIST FOR WHAT DISTINGUISHES THAT PHILOSOPHER FROM ALL OTHERSIN THE PAST IS THE VERY FACT THAT HE WAS EXACTLY THE REVERSE OF ANIMMORALIST. ZARATHUSTRA WAS THE FIRST TO SEE IN THE STRUGGLE BETWEENGOOD AND EVIL THE ESSENTIAL WHEEL IN THE WORKING OF THINGS. THETRANSLATION OF MORALITY INTO THE METAPHYSICAL AS FORCE CAUSE END INITSELF WAS HIS WORK. BUT THE VERY QUESTION SUGGESTS ITS OWN ANSWER.ZARATHUSTRA CREATED THE MOST PORTENTOUS ERROR MORALITY CONSEQUENTLY HESHOULD ALSO BE THE FIRST TO PERCEIVE THAT ERROR NOT ONLY BECAUSE HEHAS HAD LONGER AND GREATER EXPERIENCE OF THE SUBJECT THAN ANY OTHERTHINKERALL HISTORY IS THE EXPERIMENTAL REFUTATION OF THE THEORY OFTHE SOCALLED MORAL ORDER OF THINGSTHE MORE IMPORTANT POINT IS THATZARATHUSTRA WAS MORE TRUTHFUL THAN ANY OTHER THINKER. IN HIS TEACHINGALONE DO WE MEET WITH TRUTHFULNESS UPHELD AS THE HIGHEST VIRTUEI.E.THE REVERSE OF THE COWARDICE OF THE IDEALIST WHO FLEES FROM REALITY.ZARATHUSTRA HAD MORE COURAGE IN HIS BODY THAN ANY OTHER THINKER BEFOREOR AFTER HIM. TO TELL THE TRUTH AND TO AIM STRAIGHT THAT IS THE FIRSTPERSIAN VIRTUE. AM I UNDERSTOOD... THE OVERCOMING OF MORALITY THROUGHITSELFTHROUGH TRUTHFULNESS THE OVERCOMING OF THE MORALIST THROUGH HISOPPOSITETHROUGH ME THAT IS WHAT THE NAME ZARATHUSTRA MEANS IN MYMOUTH.ELIZABETH FORSTERNIETZSCHE.NIETZSCHE ARCHIVESWEIMAR DECEMBER .THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA.FIRST PART. ZARATHUSTRAS DISCOURSES.ZARATHUSTRAS PROLOGUE..WHEN ZARATHUSTRA WAS THIRTY YEARS OLD HE LEFT HIS HOME AND THE LAKE OFHIS HOME AND WENT INTO THE MOUNTAINS. THERE HE ENJOYED HIS SPIRIT ANDSOLITUDE AND FOR TEN YEARS DID NOT WEARY OF IT.

IN THE MEANTIME OF COURSE THE ROPEDANCER HAD COMMENCED HISPERFORMANCE HE HAD COME OUT AT A LITTLE DOOR AND WAS GOING ALONG THEROPE WHICH WAS STRETCHED BETWEEN TWO TOWERS SO THAT IT HUNG ABOVE THEMARKETPLACE AND THE PEOPLE. WHEN HE WAS JUST MIDWAY ACROSS THE LITTLEDOOR OPENED ONCE MORE AND A GAUDILYDRESSED FELLOW LIKE A BUFFOONSPRANG OUT AND WENT RAPIDLY AFTER THE FIRST ONE.

WHEN HOWEVER HEWAS BUT A STEP BEHIND THERE HAPPENED THE FRIGHTFUL THING WHICH MADEEVERY MOUTH MUTE AND EVERY EYE FIXEDHE UTTERED A YELL LIKE A DEVILAND JUMPED OVER THE OTHER WHO WAS IN HIS WAY. THE LATTER HOWEVER WHENHE THUS SAW HIS RIVAL TRIUMPH LOST AT THE SAME TIME HIS HEAD AND HISFOOTING ON THE ROPE HE THREW HIS POLE AWAY AND SHOT DOWNWARDS FASTERTHAN IT LIKE AN EDDY OF ARMS AND LEGS INTO THE DEPTH. THE MARKETPLACEAND THE PEOPLE WERE LIKE THE SEA WHEN THE STORM COMETH ON THEY ALL FLEWAPART AND IN DISORDER ESPECIALLY WHERE THE BODY WAS ABOUT TO FALL.ZARATHUSTRA HOWEVER REMAINED STANDING AND JUST BESIDE HIM FELL THEBODY BADLY INJURED AND DISFIGURED BUT NOT YET DEAD. AFTER A WHILECONSCIOUSNESS RETURNED TO THE SHATTERED MAN AND HE SAW ZARATHUSTRAKNEELING BESIDE HIM. WHAT ART THOU DOING THERE SAID HE AT LAST IKNEW LONG AGO THAT THE DEVIL WOULD TRIP ME UP.

THEN THE PEOPLE DISPERSED FOR EVEN CURIOSITY AND TERROR BECOMEFATIGUED. ZARATHUSTRA HOWEVER STILL SAT BESIDE THE DEAD MAN ON THEGROUND ABSORBED IN THOUGHT SO HE FORGOT THE TIME. BUT AT LAST ITBECAME NIGHT AND A COLD WIND BLEW UPON THE LONELY ONE. THEN AROSEZARATHUSTRA AND SAID TO HIS HEARTVERILY A FINE CATCH OF FISH HATH ZARATHUSTRA MADE TODAY IT IS NOT AMAN HE HATH CAUGHT BUT A CORPSE.SOMBRE IS HUMAN LIFE AND AS YET WITHOUT MEANING A BUFFOON MAY BEFATEFUL TO IT.I WANT TO TEACH MEN THE SENSE OF THEIR EXISTENCE WHICH IS THE SUPERMANTHE LIGHTNING OUT OF THE DARK CLOUDMAN.BUT STILL AM I FAR FROM THEM AND MY SENSE SPEAKETH NOT UNTO THEIRSENSE. TO MEN I AM STILL SOMETHING BETWEEN A FOOL AND A CORPSE.GLOOMY IS THE NIGHT GLOOMY ARE THE WAYS OF ZARATHUSTRA. COME THOU COLDAND STIFF COMPANION I CARRY THEE TO THE PLACE WHERE I SHALL BURY THEEWITH MINE OWN HANDS..WHEN ZARATHUSTRA HAD SAID THIS TO HIS HEART HE PUT THE CORPSE UPON HISSHOULDERS AND SET OUT ON HIS WAY. YET HAD HE NOT GONE A HUNDRED STEPSWHEN THERE STOLE A MAN UP TO HIM AND WHISPERED IN HIS EARAND LOHE THAT SPAKE WAS THE BUFFOON FROM THE TOWER.

AND WHEN HE HAD SAID THIS THE BUFFOONVANISHED ZARATHUSTRA HOWEVER WENT ON THROUGH THE DARK STREETS.AT THE GATE OF THE TOWN THE GRAVEDIGGERS MET HIM THEY SHONE THEIRTORCH ON HIS FACE AND RECOGNISING ZARATHUSTRA THEY SORELY DERIDEDHIM. ZARATHUSTRA IS CARRYING AWAY THE DEAD DOG A FINE THING THATZARATHUSTRA HATH TURNED A GRAVEDIGGER FOR OUR HANDS ARE TOO CLEANLYFOR THAT ROAST.

WHEN HE HADGONE ON FOR TWO HOURS PAST FORESTS AND SWAMPS HE HAD HEARD TOO MUCH OFTHE HUNGRY HOWLING OF THE WOLVES AND HE HIMSELF BECAME AHUNGRY. SO HEHALTED AT A LONELY HOUSE IN WHICH A LIGHT WAS BURNING.HUNGER ATTACKETH ME SAID ZARATHUSTRA LIKE A ROBBER. AMONG FORESTSAND SWAMPS MY HUNGER ATTACKETH ME AND LATE IN THE NIGHT.STRANGE HUMOURS HATH MY HUNGER. OFTEN IT COMETH TO ME ONLY AFTER AREPAST AND ALL DAY IT HATH FAILED TO COME WHERE HATH IT BEENAND THEREUPON ZARATHUSTRA KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE. AN OLD MANAPPEARED WHO CARRIED A LIGHT AND ASKED WHO COMETH UNTO ME AND MY BADSLEEPA LIVING MAN AND A DEAD ONE SAID ZARATHUSTRA. GIVE ME SOMETHING TOEAT AND DRINK I FORGOT IT DURING THE DAY.

WHEN THE MORNING DAWNEDHOWEVER ZARATHUSTRA FOUND HIMSELF IN A THICK FOREST AND NO PATH WASANY LONGER VISIBLE. HE THEN PUT THE DEAD MAN IN A HOLLOW TREE AT HISHEADFOR HE WANTED TO PROTECT HIM FROM THE WOLVESAND LAID HIMSELFDOWN ON THE GROUND AND MOSS. AND IMMEDIATELY HE FELL ASLEEP TIRED INBODY BUT WITH A TRANQUIL SOUL..LONG SLEPT ZARATHUSTRA AND NOT ONLY THE ROSY DAWN PASSED OVER HIS HEADBUT ALSO THE MORNING. AT LAST HOWEVER HIS EYES OPENED AND AMAZEDLY HEGAZED INTO THE FOREST AND THE STILLNESS AMAZEDLY HE GAZED INTO HIMSELF.THEN HE AROSE QUICKLY LIKE A SEAFARER WHO ALL AT ONCE SEETH THE LANDAND HE SHOUTED FOR JOY FOR HE SAW A NEW TRUTH.

THE SIGN.IN THE MORNING HOWEVER AFTER THIS NIGHT ZARATHUSTRA JUMPED UP FROMHIS COUCH AND HAVING GIRDED HIS LOINS HE CAME OUT OF HIS CAVE GLOWINGAND STRONG LIKE A MORNING SUN COMING OUT OF GLOOMY MOUNTAINS.THOU GREAT STAR SPAKE HE AS HE HAD SPOKEN ONCE BEFORE THOU DEEPEYE OF HAPPINESS WHAT WOULD BE ALL THY HAPPINESS IF THOU HADST NOTTHOSE FOR WHOM THOU SHINESTAND IF THEY REMAINED IN THEIR CHAMBERS WHILST THOU ART ALREADY AWAKEAND COMEST AND BESTOWEST AND DISTRIBUTEST HOW WOULD THY PROUD MODESTYUPBRAID FOR ITWELL THEY STILL SLEEP THESE HIGHER MEN WHILST I AM AWAKE THEY ARENOT MY PROPER COMPANIONS NOT FOR THEM DO I WAIT HERE IN MY MOUNTAINS.AT MY WORK I WANT TO BE AT MY DAY BUT THEY UNDERSTAND NOT WHAT ARE THESIGNS OF MY MORNING MY STEPIS NOT FOR THEM THE AWAKENINGCALL.THEY STILL SLEEP IN MY CAVE THEIR DREAM STILL DRINKETH AT MY DRUNKENSONGS. THE AUDIENT EAR FOR METHE OBEDIENT EAR IS YET LACKING IN THEIRLIMBS.THIS HAD ZARATHUSTRA SPOKEN TO HIS HEART WHEN THE SUN AROSE THENLOOKED HE INQUIRINGLY ALOFT FOR HE HEARD ABOVE HIM THE SHARP CALL OFHIS EAGLE. WELL CALLED HE UPWARDS THUS IS IT PLEASING AND PROPER TOME. MINE ANIMALS ARE AWAKE FOR I AM AWAKE.MINE EAGLE IS AWAKE AND LIKE ME HONOURETH THE SUN. WITH EAGLETALONSDOTH IT GRASP AT THE NEW LIGHT. YE ARE MY PROPER ANIMALS I LOVE YOU.BUT STILL DO I LACK MY PROPER MENTHUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA THEN HOWEVER IT HAPPENED THAT ALL ON A SUDDENHE BECAME AWARE THAT HE WAS FLOCKED AROUND AND FLUTTERED AROUND AS IFBY INNUMERABLE BIRDSTHE WHIZZING OF SO MANY WINGS HOWEVER AND THECROWDING AROUND HIS HEAD WAS SO GREAT THAT HE SHUT HIS EYES. AND VERILYTHERE CAME DOWN UPON HIM AS IT WERE A CLOUD LIKE A CLOUD OF ARROWSWHICH POURETH UPON A NEW ENEMY. BUT BEHOLD HERE IT WAS A CLOUD OF LOVEAND SHOWERED UPON A NEW FRIEND.WHAT HAPPENETH UNTO ME THOUGHT ZARATHUSTRA IN HIS ASTONISHED HEARTAND SLOWLY SEATED HIMSELF ON THE BIG STONE WHICH LAY CLOSE TO THE EXITFROM HIS CAVE. BUT WHILE HE GRASPED ABOUT WITH HIS HANDS AROUND HIMABOVE HIM AND BELOW HIM AND REPELLED THE TENDER BIRDS BEHOLD THERETHEN HAPPENED TO HIM SOMETHING STILL STRANGER FOR HE GRASPED THEREBYUNAWARES INTO A MASS OF THICK WARM SHAGGY HAIR AT THE SAME TIMEHOWEVER THERE SOUNDED BEFORE HIM A ROARA LONG SOFT LIONROAR.THE SIGN COMETH SAID ZARATHUSTRA AND A CHANGE CAME OVER HIS HEART.AND IN TRUTH WHEN IT TURNED CLEAR BEFORE HIM THERE LAY A YELLOWPOWERFUL ANIMAL AT HIS FEET RESTING ITS HEAD ON HIS KNEEUNWILLING TOLEAVE HIM OUT OF LOVE AND DOING LIKE A DOG WHICH AGAIN FINDETH ITS OLDMASTER. THE DOVES HOWEVER WERE NO LESS EAGER WITH THEIR LOVE THAN THELION AND WHENEVER A DOVE WHISKED OVER ITS NOSE THE LION SHOOK ITS HEADAND WONDERED AND LAUGHED.WHEN ALL THIS WENT ON ZARATHUSTRA SPAKE ONLY A WORD MY CHILDREN ARENIGH MY CHILDREN THEN HE BECAME QUITE MUTE. HIS HEART HOWEVERWAS LOOSED AND FROM HIS EYES THERE DROPPED DOWN TEARS AND FELL UPONHIS HANDS. AND HE TOOK NO FURTHER NOTICE OF ANYTHING BUT SAT THEREMOTIONLESS WITHOUT REPELLING THE ANIMALS FURTHER. THEN FLEW THE DOVESTO AND FRO AND PERCHED ON HIS SHOULDER AND CARESSED HIS WHITE HAIRAND DID NOT TIRE OF THEIR TENDERNESS AND JOYOUSNESS. THE STRONG LIONHOWEVER LICKED ALWAYS THE TEARS THAT FELL ON ZARATHUSTRAS HANDS ANDROARED AND GROWLED SHYLY. THUS DID THESE ANIMALS DO.ALL THIS WENT ON FOR A LONG TIME OR A SHORT TIME FOR PROPERLYSPEAKING THERE IS NO TIME ON EARTH FOR SUCH THINGS. MEANWHILEHOWEVER THE HIGHER MEN HAD AWAKENED IN ZARATHUSTRAS CAVE ANDMARSHALLED THEMSELVES FOR A PROCESSION TO GO TO MEET ZARATHUSTRA ANDGIVE HIM THEIR MORNING GREETING FOR THEY HAD FOUND WHEN THEY AWAKENEDTHAT HE NO LONGER TARRIED WITH THEM. WHEN HOWEVER THEY REACHED THEDOOR OF THE CAVE AND THE NOISE OF THEIR STEPS HAD PRECEDED THEM THELION STARTED VIOLENTLY IT TURNED AWAY ALL AT ONCE FROM ZARATHUSTRA ANDROARING WILDLY SPRANG TOWARDS THE CAVE. THE HIGHER MEN HOWEVER WHENTHEY HEARD THE LION ROARING CRIED ALL ALOUD AS WITH ONE VOICE FLEDBACK AND VANISHED IN AN INSTANT.ZARATHUSTRA HIMSELF HOWEVER STUNNED AND STRANGE ROSE FROM HIS SEATLOOKED AROUND HIM STOOD THERE ASTONISHED INQUIRED OF HIS HEARTBETHOUGHT HIMSELF AND REMAINED ALONE. WHAT DID I HEAR SAID HE ATLAST SLOWLY WHAT HAPPENED UNTO ME JUST NOWBUT SOON THERE CAME TO HIM HIS RECOLLECTION AND HE TOOK IN AT A GLANCEALL THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN YESTERDAY AND TODAY. HERE IS INDEEDTHE STONE SAID HE AND STROKED HIS BEARD ON IT SAT I YESTERMORNAND HERE CAME THE SOOTHSAYER UNTO ME AND HERE HEARD I FIRST THE CRYWHICH I HEARD JUST NOW THE GREAT CRY OF DISTRESS.O YE HIGHER MEN YOUR DISTRESS WAS IT THAT THE OLD SOOTHSAYER FORETOLDTO ME YESTERMORNUNTO YOUR DISTRESS DID HE WANT TO SEDUCE AND TEMPT ME OZARATHUSTRA SAID HE TO ME I COME TO SEDUCE THEE TO THY LAST SIN.TO MY LAST SIN CRIED ZARATHUSTRA AND LAUGHED ANGRILY AT HIS OWNWORDS WHAT HATH BEEN RESERVED FOR ME AS MY LAST SINAND ONCE MORE ZARATHUSTRA BECAME ABSORBED IN HIMSELF AND SAT DOWNAGAIN ON THE BIG STONE AND MEDITATED. SUDDENLY HE SPRANG UPFELLOWSUFFERING FELLOWSUFFERING WITH THE HIGHER MEN HE CRIED OUTAND HIS COUNTENANCE CHANGED INTO BRASS. WELL THATHATH HAD ITS TIMEMY SUFFERING AND MY FELLOWSUFFERINGWHAT MATTER ABOUT THEM DO I THENSTRIVE AFTER HAPPINESS I STRIVE AFTER MY WORKWELL THE LION HATH COME MY CHILDREN ARE NIGH ZARATHUSTRA HATH GROWNRIPE MINE HOUR HATH COMETHIS IS MY MORNING MY DAY BEGINNETH ARISE NOW ARISE THOU GREATNOONTIDETHUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA AND LEFT HIS CAVE GLOWING AND STRONG LIKE AMORNING SUN COMING OUT OF GLOOMY MOUNTAINS.APPENDIX.NOTES ON THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA BY ANTHONY M. LUDOVICI.I HAVE HAD SOME OPPORTUNITIES OF STUDYING THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICHNIETZSCHE IS READ IN GERMANY FRANCE AND ENGLAND AND I HAVE FOUNDTHAT IN EACH OF THESE COUNTRIES STUDENTS OF HIS PHILOSOPHY AS IFACTUATED BY PRECISELY SIMILAR MOTIVES AND DESIRES AND MISLED BY THESAME MISTAKEN TACTICS ON THE PART OF MOST PUBLISHERS ALL PROCEED IN THESAME HAPPYGOLUCKY STYLE WHEN TAKING HIM UP. THEY HAVE HAD IT SAID TOTHEM THAT HE WROTE WITHOUT ANY SYSTEM AND THEY VERY NATURALLY CONCLUDETHAT IT DOES NOT MATTER IN THE LEAST WHETHER THEY BEGIN WITH HIS FIRSTTHIRD OR LAST BOOK PROVIDED THEY CAN OBTAIN A FEW VAGUE IDEAS AS TOWHAT HIS LEADING AND MOST SENSATIONAL PRINCIPLES WERE.NOW IT IS CLEAR THAT THE BOOK WITH THE MOST MYSTERIOUS STARTLING ORSUGGESTIVE TITLE WILL ALWAYS STAND THE BEST CHANCE OF BEING PURCHASEDBY THOSE WHO HAVE NO OTHER CRITERIA TO GUIDE THEM IN THEIR CHOICETHAN THE ASPECT OF A TITLEPAGE AND THIS EXPLAINS WHY THUS SPAKEZARATHUSTRA IS ALMOST ALWAYS THE FIRST AND OFTEN THE ONLY ONE OFNIETZSCHES BOOKS THAT FALLS INTO THE HANDS OF THE UNINITIATED.THE TITLE SUGGESTS ALL KINDS OF MYSTERIES A GLANCE AT THECHAPTERHEADINGS QUICKLY CONFIRMS THE SUSPICIONS ALREADY AROUSEDAND THE SUBTITLE A BOOK FOR ALL AND NONE GENERALLY SUCCEEDS INDISSIPATING THE LAST DOUBTS THE PROSPECTIVE PURCHASER MAY ENTERTAINCONCERNING HIS FITNESS FOR THE BOOK OR ITS FITNESS FOR HIM. AND WHATHAPPENSTHUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA IS TAKEN HOME THE READER WHO PERCHANCE MAYKNOW NO MORE CONCERNING NIETZSCHE THAN A MAGAZINE ARTICLE HAS TOLD HIMTRIES TO READ IT AND UNDERSTANDING LESS THAN HALF HE READS PROBABLYNEVER GETS FURTHER THAN THE SECOND OR THIRD PARTAND THEN ONLY TO FEELCONVINCED THAT NIETZSCHE HIMSELF WAS RATHER HAZY AS TO WHAT HE WASTALKING ABOUT. SUCH CHAPTERS AS THE CHILD WITH THE MIRROR IN THEHAPPY ISLES THE GRAVESONG IMMACULATE PERCEPTION THE STILLESTHOUR THE SEVEN SEALS AND MANY OTHERS ARE ALMOST UTTERLY DEVOID OFMEANING TO ALL THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW SOMETHING OF NIETZSCHES LIFE HISAIMS AND HIS FRIENDSHIPS.AS A MATTER OF FACT THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA THOUGH IT ISUNQUESTIONABLY NIETZSCHES OPUS MAGNUM IS BY NO MEANS THE FIRST OFNIETZSCHES WORKS THAT THE BEGINNER OUGHT TO UNDERTAKE TO READ. THEAUTHOR HIMSELF REFERS TO IT AS THE DEEPEST WORK EVER OFFERED TO THEGERMAN PUBLIC AND ELSEWHERE SPEAKS OF HIS OTHER WRITINGS AS BEINGNECESSARY FOR THE UNDERSTANDING OF IT. BUT WHEN IT IS REMEMBERED THATIN ZARATHUSTRA WE NOT ONLY HAVE THE HISTORY OF HIS MOST INTIMATEEXPERIENCES FRIENDSHIPS FEUDS DISAPPOINTMENTS TRIUMPHS AND THE LIKEBUT THAT THE VERY FORM IN WHICH THEY ARE NARRATED IS ONE WHICH TENDSRATHER TO OBSCURE THAN TO THROW LIGHT UPON THEM THE DIFFICULTIES WHICHMEET THE READER WHO STARTS QUITE UNPREPARED WILL BE SEEN TO BE REALLYFORMIDABLE.ZARATHUSTRA THENTHIS SHADOWY ALLEGORICAL PERSONALITY SPEAKING INALLEGORIES AND PARABLES AND AT TIMES NOT EVEN REFRAINING FROM RELATINGHIS OWN DREAMSIS A FIGURE WE CAN UNDERSTAND BUT VERY IMPERFECTLY IF WEHAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF HIS CREATOR AND COUNTERPART FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHEAND IT WERE THEREFORE WELL PREVIOUS TO OUR STUDY OF THE MORE ABSTRUSEPARTS OF THIS BOOK IF WE WERE TO TURN TO SOME AUTHORITATIVE BOOK ONNIETZSCHES LIFE AND WORKS AND TO READ ALL THAT IS THERE SAID ON THESUBJECT. THOSE WHO CAN READ GERMAN WILL FIND AN EXCELLENT GUIDE IN THISRESPECT IN FRAU FOERSTERNIETZSCHES EXHAUSTIVE AND HIGHLY INTERESTINGBIOGRAPHY OF HER BROTHER DAS LEBEN FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHES PUBLISHEDBY NAUMANN WHILE THE WORKS OF DEUSSEN RAOUL RICHTER AND BARONESSISABELLE VON UNGERSTERNBERG WILL BE FOUND TO THROW USEFUL ANDNECESSARY LIGHT UPON MANY QUESTIONS WHICH IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR ASISTER TO TOUCH UPON.IN REGARD TO THE ACTUAL PHILOSOPHICAL VIEWS EXPOUNDED IN THIS WORKTHERE IS AN EXCELLENT WAY OF CLEARING UP ANY DIFFICULTIES THEY MAYPRESENT AND THAT IS BY AN APPEAL TO NIETZSCHES OTHER WORKS. AGAIN ANDAGAIN OF COURSE HE WILL BE FOUND TO EXPRESS HIMSELF SO CLEARLY THATALL REFERENCE TO HIS OTHER WRITINGS MAY BE DISPENSED WITH BUT WHERETHIS IS NOT THE CASE THE ADVICE HE HIMSELF GIVES IS AFTER ALL THE BESTTO BE FOLLOWED HERE VIZ.TO REGARD SUCH WORKS AS JOYFUL SCIENCEBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL THE GENEALOGY OF MORALS THE TWILIGHT OFTHE IDOLS THE ANTICHRIST THE WILL TO POWER ETC. ETC. AS THENECESSARY PREPARATION FOR THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA.THESE DIRECTIONS THOUGH THEY ARE BY NO MEANS SIMPLE TO CARRY OUT SEEMAT LEAST TO POSSESS THE QUALITY OF DEFINITENESS AND STRAIGHTFORWARDNESS.FOLLOW THEM AND ALL WILL BE CLEAR I SEEM TO IMPLY. BUT I REGRET TOSAY THAT THIS IS NOT REALLY THE CASE. FOR MY EXPERIENCE TELLS ME THATEVEN AFTER THE ABOVE DIRECTIONS HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED WITH THE GREATESTPOSSIBLE ZEAL THE STUDENT WILL STILL HALT IN PERPLEXITY BEFORE CERTAINPASSAGES IN THE BOOK BEFORE US AND WONDER WHAT THEY MEAN. NOW IT ISWITH THE VIEW OF GIVING A LITTLE ADDITIONAL HELP TO ALL THOSE WHO FINDTHEMSELVES IN THIS POSITION THAT I PROCEED TO PUT FORTH MY OWN PERSONALINTERPRETATION OF THE MORE ABSTRUSE PASSAGES IN THIS WORK.IN OFFERING THIS LITTLE COMMENTARY TO THE NIETZSCHE STUDENT I SHOULDLIKE IT TO BE UNDERSTOOD THAT I MAKE NO CLAIM AS TO ITS INFALLIBILITY ORINDISPENSABILITY. IT REPRESENTS BUT AN ATTEMPT ON MY PARTA VERY FEEBLEONE PERHAPSTO GIVE THE READER WHAT LITTLE HELP I CAN IN SURMOUNTINGDIFFICULTIES WHICH A LONG STUDY OF NIETZSCHES LIFE AND WORKS HASENABLED ME PARTIALLY I HOPE TO OVERCOME. ...PERHAPS IT WOULD BE AS WELL TO START OUT WITH A BROAD AND RAPID SKETCHOF NIETZSCHE AS A WRITER ON MORALS EVOLUTION AND SOCIOLOGY SO THATTHE READER MAY BE PREPARED TO PICK OUT FOR HIMSELF SO TO SPEAK ALLPASSAGES IN THIS WORK BEARING IN ANY WAY UPON NIETZSCHES VIEWS IN THOSETHREE IMPORTANT BRANCHES OF KNOWLEDGE.A. NIETZSCHE AND MORALITY.IN MORALITY NIETZSCHE STARTS OUT BY ADOPTING THE POSITION OF THERELATIVIST. HE SAYS THERE ARE NO ABSOLUTE VALUES GOOD AND EVILTHESE ARE MERE MEANS ADOPTED BY ALL IN ORDER TO ACQUIRE POWER TOMAINTAIN THEIR PLACE IN THE WORLD OR TO BECOME SUPREME. IT IS THELIONS GOOD TO DEVOUR AN ANTELOPE. IT IS THE DEADLEAF BUTTERFLYSGOOD TO TELL A FOE A FALSEHOOD. FOR WHEN THE DEADLEAF BUTTERFLY IS INDANGER IT CLINGS TO THE SIDE OF A TWIG AND WHAT IT SAYS TO ITS FOE ISPRACTICALLY THIS I AM NOT A BUTTERFLY I AM A DEAD LEAF AND CAN BEOF NO USE TO THEE. THIS IS A LIE WHICH IS GOOD TO THE BUTTERFLY FORIT PRESERVES IT. IN NATURE EVERY SPECIES OF ORGANIC BEING INSTINCTIVELYADOPTS AND PRACTISES THOSE ACTS WHICH MOST CONDUCE TO THE PREVALENCEOR SUPREMACY OF ITS KIND. ONCE THE MOST FAVOURABLE ORDER OF CONDUCT ISFOUND PROVED EFFICIENT AND ESTABLISHED IT BECOMES THE RULING MORALITYOF THE SPECIES THAT ADOPTS IT AND BEARS THEM ALONG TO VICTORY. ALLSPECIES MUST NOT AND CANNOT VALUE ALIKE FOR WHAT IS THE LIONS GOOD ISTHE ANTELOPES EVIL AND VICE VERSA.CONCEPTS OF GOOD AND EVIL ARE THEREFORE IN THEIR ORIGIN MERELY A MEANSTO AN END THEY ARE EXPEDIENTS FOR ACQUIRING POWER.APPLYING THIS PRINCIPLE TO MANKIND NIETZSCHE ATTACKED CHRISTIANMORAL VALUES. HE DECLARED THEM TO BE LIKE ALL OTHER MORALS MERELYAN EXPEDIENT FOR PROTECTING A CERTAIN TYPE OF MAN. IN THE CASE OFCHRISTIANITY THIS TYPE WAS ACCORDING TO NIETZSCHE A LOW ONE.CONFLICTING MORAL CODES HAVE BEEN NO MORE THAN THE CONFLICTING WEAPONSOF DIFFERENT CLASSES OF MEN FOR IN MANKIND THERE IS A CONTINUAL WARBETWEEN THE POWERFUL THE NOBLE THE STRONG AND THE WELLCONSTITUTEDON THE ONE SIDE AND THE IMPOTENT THE MEAN THE WEAK AND THEILLCONSTITUTED ON THE OTHER. THE WAR IS A WAR OF MORAL PRINCIPLES.THE MORALITY OF THE POWERFUL CLASS NIETZSCHE CALLS NOBLE ORMASTERMORALITY THAT OF THE WEAK AND SUBORDINATE CLASS HE CALLSSLAVEMORALITY. IN THE FIRST MORALITY IT IS THE EAGLE WHICH LOOKINGDOWN UPON A BROWSING LAMB CONTENDS THAT EATING LAMB IS GOOD. IN THESECOND THE SLAVEMORALITY IT IS THE LAMB WHICH LOOKING UP FROM THESWARD BLEATS DISSENTINGLY EATING LAMB IS EVIL.B. THE MASTER AND SLAVEMORALITY COMPARED.THE FIRST MORALITY IS ACTIVE CREATIVE DIONYSIAN. THE SECOND ISPASSIVE DEFENSIVETO IT BELONGS THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE.WHERE ATTEMPTS HAVE NOT BEEN MADE TO RECONCILE THE TWO MORALITIES THEYMAY BE DESCRIBED AS FOLLOWSALL IS GOOD IN THE NOBLE MORALITY WHICHPROCEEDS FROM STRENGTH POWER HEALTH WELLCONSTITUTEDNESS HAPPINESSAND AWFULNESS FOR THE MOTIVE FORCE BEHIND THE PEOPLE PRACTISING IT ISTHE STRUGGLE FOR POWER. THE ANTITHESIS GOOD AND BAD TO THISFIRST CLASS MEANS THE SAME AS NOBLE AND DESPICABLE. BAD IN THEMASTERMORALITY MUST BE APPLIED TO THE COWARD TO ALL ACTS THAT SPRINGFROM WEAKNESS TO THE MAN WITH AN EYE TO THE MAIN CHANCE WHO WOULDFORSAKE EVERYTHING IN ORDER TO LIVE.WITH THE SECOND THE SLAVEMORALITY THE CASE IS DIFFERENT. THEREINASMUCH AS THE COMMUNITY IS AN OPPRESSED SUFFERING UNEMANCIPATED ANDWEARY ONE ALL THAT WILL BE HELD TO BE GOOD WHICH ALLEVIATES THESTATE OF SUFFERING. PITY THE OBLIGING HAND THE WARM HEART PATIENCEINDUSTRY AND HUMILITYTHESE ARE UNQUESTIONABLY THE QUALITIES WE SHALLHERE FIND FLOODED WITH THE LIGHT OF APPROVAL AND ADMIRATION BECAUSETHEY ARE THE MOST USEFUL QUALITIES THEY MAKE LIFE ENDURABLE THEY AREOF ASSISTANCE IN THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE WHICH IS THE MOTIVE FORCEBEHIND THE PEOPLE PRACTISING THIS MORALITY. TO THIS CLASS ALL THAT ISAWFUL IS BAD IN FACT IT IS THE EVIL PAR EXCELLENCE. STRENGTH HEALTHSUPERABUNDANCE OF ANIMAL SPIRITS AND POWER ARE REGARDED WITH HATESUSPICION AND FEAR BY THE SUBORDINATE CLASS.NOW NIETZSCHE BELIEVED THAT THE FIRST OR THE NOBLEMORALITY CONDUCED TOAN ASCENT IN THE LINE OF LIFE BECAUSE IT WAS CREATIVE AND ACTIVE. ONTHE OTHER HAND HE BELIEVED THAT THE SECOND OR SLAVEMORALITY WHEREIT BECAME PARAMOUNT LED TO DEGENERATION BECAUSE IT WAS PASSIVE ANDDEFENSIVE WANTING MERELY TO KEEP THOSE WHO PRACTISED IT ALIVE. HENCEHIS EARNEST ADVOCACY OF NOBLEMORALITY.C. NIETZSCHE AND EVOLUTION.NIETZSCHE AS AN EVOLUTIONIST I SHALL HAVE OCCASION TO DEFINE AND DISCUSSIN THE COURSE OF THESE NOTES SEE NOTES ON CHAPTER LVI. PAR. AND ONCHAPTER LVII.. FOR THE PRESENT LET IT SUFFICE FOR US TO KNOW THAT HEACCEPTED THE DEVELOPMENT HYPOTHESIS AS AN EXPLANATION OF THE ORIGIN OFSPECIES BUT HE DID NOT HALT WHERE MOST NATURALISTS HAVE HALTED. HEBY NO MEANS REGARDED MAN AS THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE BEING WHICH EVOLUTIONCOULD ARRIVE AT FOR THOUGH HIS PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT MAY HAVE REACHEDITS LIMIT THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH HIS MENTAL OR SPIRITUAL ATTRIBUTES.IF THE PROCESS BE A FACT IF THINGS HAVE BECOME WHAT THEY ARE THEN HECONTENDS WE MAY DESCRIBE NO LIMIT TO MANS ASPIRATIONS. IF HE STRUGGLEDUP FROM BARBARISM AND STILL MORE REMOTELY FROM THE LOWER PRIMATESHIS IDEAL SHOULD BE TO SURPASS MAN HIMSELF AND REACH SUPERMAN SEEESPECIALLY THE PROLOGUE.D. NIETZSCHE AND SOCIOLOGY.NIETZSCHE AS A SOCIOLOGIST AIMS AT AN ARISTOCRATIC ARRANGEMENT OFSOCIETY. HE WOULD HAVE US REAR AN IDEAL RACE. HONEST AND TRUTHFUL ININTELLECTUAL MATTERS HE COULD NOT EVEN THINK THAT MEN ARE EQUAL. WITHTHESE PREACHERS OF EQUALITY WILL I NOT BE MIXED UP AND CONFOUNDED. FORTHUS SPEAKETH JUSTICE UNTO ME MEN ARE NOT EQUAL. HE SEES PRECISELYIN THIS INEQUALITY A PURPOSE TO BE SERVED A CONDITION TO BE EXPLOITED.EVERY ELEVATION OF THE TYPE MAN HE WRITES IN BEYOND GOOD ANDEVIL HAS HITHERTO BEEN THE WORK OF AN ARISTOCRATIC SOCIETYAND SOWILL IT ALWAYS BEA SOCIETY BELIEVING IN A LONG SCALE OF GRADATIONS OFRANK AND DIFFERENCES OF WORTH AMONG HUMAN BEINGS.THOSE WHO ARE SUFFICIENTLY INTERESTED TO DESIRE TO READ HIS OWN DETAILEDACCOUNT OF THE SOCIETY HE WOULD FAIN ESTABLISH WILL FIND AN EXCELLENTPASSAGE IN APHORISM OF THE ANTICHRIST. ...PART I. THE PROLOGUE.IN PART I. INCLUDING THE PROLOGUE NO VERY GREAT DIFFICULTIES WILLAPPEAR. ZARATHUSTRAS HABIT OF DESIGNATING A WHOLE CLASS OF MEN OR AWHOLE SCHOOL OF THOUGHT BY A SINGLE FITTING NICKNAME MAY PERHAPS LEAD TOA LITTLE CONFUSION AT FIRST BUT AS A RULE WHEN THE GENERAL DRIFTOF HIS ARGUMENTS IS GRASPED IT REQUIRES BUT A SLIGHT EFFORT OF THEIMAGINATION TO DISCOVER WHOM HE IS REFERRING TO. IN THE NINTH PARAGRAPHOF THE PROLOGUE FOR INSTANCE IT IS QUITE OBVIOUS THAT HERDSMEN INTHE VERSE HERDSMEN I SAY ETC. ETC. STANDS FOR ALL THOSE TODAYWHO ARE THE ADVOCATES OF GREGARIOUSNESSOF THE ANTHILL. AND WHEN OURAUTHOR SAYS A ROBBER SHALL ZARATHUSTRA BE CALLED BY THE HERDSMEN ITIS CLEAR THAT THESE WORDS MAY BE TAKEN ALMOST LITERALLY FROM ONE WHOSEIDEAL WAS THE REARING OF A HIGHER ARISTOCRACY. AGAIN THE GOOD ANDJUST THROUGHOUT THE BOOK IS THE EXPRESSION USED IN REFERRING TO THESELFRIGHTEOUS OF MODERN TIMESTHOSE WHO ARE QUITE SURE THAT THEYKNOW ALL THAT IS TO BE KNOWN CONCERNING GOOD AND EVIL AND ARE SATISFIEDTHAT THE VALUES THEIR LITTLE WORLD OF TRADITION HAS HANDED DOWN TO THEMARE DESTINED TO RULE MANKIND AS LONG AS IT LASTS.IN THE LAST PARAGRAPH OF THE PROLOGUE VERSE ZARATHUSTRA GIVES US AFORETASTE OF HIS TEACHING CONCERNING THE BIG AND THE LITTLE SAGACITIESEXPOUNDED SUBSEQUENTLY. HE SAYS HE WOULD HE WERE AS WISE AS HIS SERPENTTHIS DESIRE WILL BE FOUND EXPLAINED IN THE DISCOURSE ENTITLED THEDESPISERS OF THE BODY WHICH I SHALL HAVE OCCASION TO REFER TO LATER. ...THE DISCOURSES.CHAPTER I. THE THREE METAMORPHOSES.THIS OPENING DISCOURSE IS A PARABLE IN WHICH ZARATHUSTRA DISCLOSES THEMENTAL DEVELOPMENT OF ALL CREATORS OF NEW VALUES. IT IS THE STORY OFA LIFE WHICH REACHES ITS CONSUMMATION IN ATTAINING TO A SECONDINGENUOUSNESS OR IN RETURNING TO CHILDHOOD. NIETZSCHE THE SUPPOSEDANARCHIST HERE PLAINLY DISCLAIMS ALL RELATIONSHIP WHATEVER TO ANARCHYFOR HE SHOWS US THAT ONLY BY BEARING THE BURDENS OF THE EXISTING LAW ANDSUBMITTING TO IT PATIENTLY AS THE CAMEL SUBMITS TO BEING LADEN DOESTHE FREE SPIRIT ACQUIRE THAT ASCENDANCY OVER TRADITION WHICH ENABLES HIMTO MEET AND MASTER THE DRAGON THOU SHALTTHE DRAGON WITH THE VALUESOF A THOUSAND YEARS GLITTERING ON ITS SCALES. THERE ARE TWO LESSONS INTHIS DISCOURSE FIRST THAT IN ORDER TO CREATE ONE MUST BE AS A LITTLECHILD SECONDLY THAT IT IS ONLY THROUGH EXISTING LAW AND ORDER THATONE ATTAINS TO THAT HEIGHT FROM WHICH NEW LAW AND NEW ORDER MAY BEPROMULGATED.CHAPTER II. THE ACADEMIC CHAIRS OF VIRTUE.ALMOST THE WHOLE OF THIS IS QUITE COMPREHENSIBLE. IT IS A DISCOURSEAGAINST ALL THOSE WHO CONFOUND VIRTUE WITH TAMENESS AND SMUG EASE ANDWHO REGARD AS VIRTUOUS ONLY THAT WHICH PROMOTES SECURITY AND TENDS TODEEPEN SLEEP.CHAPTER IV. THE DESPISERS OF THE BODY.HERE ZARATHUSTRA GIVES NAMES TO THE INTELLECT AND THE INSTINCTS HECALLS THE ONE THE LITTLE SAGACITY AND THE LATTER THE BIG SAGACITY. SCHOPENHAUERS TEACHING CONCERNING THE INTELLECT IS FULLY ENDORSED HERE.AN INSTRUMENT OF THY BODY IS ALSO THY LITTLE SAGACITY MY BROTHERWHICH THOU CALLEST SPIRIT SAYS ZARATHUSTRA. FROM BEGINNING TO END ITIS A WARNING TO THOSE WHO WOULD THINK TOO LIGHTLY OF THE INSTINCTSAND UNDULY EXALT THE INTELLECT AND ITS DERIVATIVES REASON ANDUNDERSTANDING.CHAPTER IX. THE PREACHERS OF DEATH.THIS IS AN ANALYSIS OF THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ALL THOSE WHO HAVE THE EVILEYE AND ARE PESSIMISTS BY VIRTUE OF THEIR CONSTITUTIONS.CHAPTER XV. THE THOUSAND AND ONE GOALS.IN THIS DISCOURSE ZARATHUSTRA OPENS HIS EXPOSITION OF THE DOCTRINE OFRELATIVITY IN MORALITY AND DECLARES ALL MORALITY TO BE A MERE MEANSTO POWER. NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT VERSES AND REFER TO THEGREEKS THE PERSIANS THE JEWS AND THE GERMANS RESPECTIVELY. IN THEPENULTIMATE VERSE HE MAKES KNOWN HIS DISCOVERY CONCERNING THE ROOT OFMODERN NIHILISM AND INDIFFERENCEI.E. THAT MODERN MAN HAS NO GOAL NOAIM NO IDEALS SEE NOTE A.CHAPTER XVIII. OLD AND YOUNG WOMEN.NIETZSCHES VIEWS ON WOMEN HAVE EITHER TO BE LOVED AT FIRST SIGHTOR THEY BECOME PERHAPS THE GREATEST OBSTACLE IN THE WAY OF THOSE WHOOTHERWISE WOULD BE INCLINED TO ACCEPT HIS PHILOSOPHY. WOMEN ESPECIALLYOF COURSE HAVE BEEN TAUGHT TO DISLIKE THEM BECAUSE IT HAS BEENRUMOURED THAT HIS VIEWS ARE UNFRIENDLY TO THEMSELVES. NOW TO MY MINDALL THIS IS PURE MISUNDERSTANDING AND ERROR.GERMAN PHILOSOPHERS THANKS TO SCHOPENHAUER HAVE EARNED RATHER A BADNAME FOR THEIR VIEWS ON WOMEN. IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR ONE OF THEMTO WRITE A LINE ON THE SUBJECT HOWEVER KINDLY HE MAY DO SO WITHOUTBEING SUSPECTED OF WISHING TO OPEN A CRUSADE AGAINST THE FAIR SEX.DESPITE THE FACT THEREFORE THAT ALL NIETZSCHES VIEWS IN THIS RESPECTWERE DICTATED TO HIM BY THE PROFOUNDEST LOVE DESPITE ZARATHUSTRASRESERVATION IN THIS DISCOURSE THAT WITH WOMEN NOTHING THAT CAN BESAID IS IMPOSSIBLE AND IN THE FACE OF OTHER OVERWHELMING EVIDENCETO THE CONTRARY NIETZSCHE IS UNIVERSALLY REPORTED TO HAVE MIS SONPIED DANS LE PLAT WHERE THE FEMALE SEX IS CONCERNED. AND WHAT IS THEFUNDAMENTAL DOCTRINE WHICH HAS GIVEN RISE TO SO MUCH BITTERNESS ANDAVERSIONMERELY THIS THAT THE SEXES ARE AT BOTTOM ANTAGONISTICTHATIS TO SAY AS DIFFERENT AS BLUE IS FROM YELLOW AND THAT THE BESTPOSSIBLE MEANS OF REARING ANYTHING APPROACHING A DESIRABLE RACE IS TOPRESERVE AND TO FOSTER THIS PROFOUND HOSTILITY. WHAT NIETZSCHE STRIVESTO COMBAT AND TO OVERTHROW IS THE MODERN DEMOCRATIC TENDENCY WHICH ISSLOWLY LABOURING TO LEVEL ALL THINGSEVEN THE SEXES. HIS QUARREL IS NOTWITH WOMENWHAT INDEED COULD BE MORE UNDIGNIFIEDIT IS WITH THOSE WHOWOULD DESTROY THE NATURAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SEXES BY MODIFYINGEITHER THE ONE OR THE OTHER WITH A VIEW TO MAKING THEM MORE ALIKE. THEHUMAN WORLD IS JUST AS DEPENDENT UPON WOMENS POWERS AS UPON MENS. ITIS WOMENS STRONGEST AND MOST VALUABLE INSTINCTS WHICH HELP TO DETERMINEWHO ARE TO BE THE FATHERS OF THE NEXT GENERATION. BY DESTROYING THESEPARTICULAR INSTINCTS THAT IS TO SAY BY ATTEMPTING TO MASCULINISE WOMANAND TO FEMINISE MEN WE JEOPARDISE THE FUTURE OF OUR PEOPLE. THE GENERALDEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT OF MODERN TIMES IN ITS FRANTIC STRUGGLE TO MITIGATEALL DIFFERENCES IS NOW INVADING EVEN THE WORLD OF SEX. IT IS AGAINSTTHIS MOVEMENT THAT NIETZSCHE RAISES HIS VOICE HE WOULD HAVE WOMANBECOME EVER MORE WOMAN AND MAN BECOME EVER MORE MAN. ONLY THUS ANDHE IS UNDOUBTEDLY RIGHT CAN THEIR COMBINED INSTINCTS LEAD TO THEEXCELLENCE OF HUMANITY. REGARDED IN THIS LIGHT ALL HIS VIEWS ON WOMANAPPEAR NOT ONLY NECESSARY BUT JUST SEE NOTE ON CHAPTER LVI. PAR. .IT IS INTERESTING TO OBSERVE THAT THE LAST LINE OF THE DISCOURSE WHICHHAS SO FREQUENTLY BEEN USED BY WOMEN AS A WEAPON AGAINST NIETZSCHESVIEWS CONCERNING THEM WAS SUGGESTED TO NIETZSCHE BY A WOMAN SEE DASLEBEN F. NIETZSCHES.CHAPTER XXI. VOLUNTARY DEATH.IN REGARD TO THIS DISCOURSE I SHOULD ONLY LIKE TO POINT OUT THATNIETZSCHE HAD A PARTICULAR AVERSION TO THE WORD SUICIDESELFMURDER.HE DISLIKED THE EVIL IT SUGGESTED AND IN RECHRISTENING THE ACTVOLUNTARY DEATH I.E. THE DEATH THAT COMES FROM NO OTHER HAND THANONES OWN HE WAS DESIROUS OF ELEVATING IT TO THE POSITION IT HELD INCLASSICAL ANTIQUITY SEE APHORISM IN THE TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS.CHAPTER XXII. THE BESTOWING VIRTUE.AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF NIETZSCHES PHILOSOPHY IS BROUGHT TO LIGHT INTHIS DISCOURSE. HIS TEACHING AS IS WELL KNOWN PLACES THE ARISTOTELIANMAN OF SPIRIT ABOVE ALL OTHERS IN THE NATURAL DIVISIONS OF MAN. THEMAN WITH OVERFLOWING STRENGTH BOTH OF MIND AND BODY WHO MUST DISCHARGETHIS STRENGTH OR PERISH IS THE NIETZSCHEAN IDEAL. TO SUCH A MAN GIVINGFROM HIS OVERFLOW BECOMES A NECESSITY BESTOWING DEVELOPS INTO A MEANSOF EXISTENCE AND THIS IS THE ONLY GIVING THE ONLY CHARITY THATNIETZSCHE RECOGNISES. IN PARAGRAPH OF THE DISCOURSE WE READZARATHUSTRAS HEALTHY EXHORTATION TO HIS DISCIPLES TO BECOME INDEPENDENTTHINKERS AND TO FIND THEMSELVES BEFORE THEY LEARN ANY MORE FROM HIM SEENOTES ON CHAPTERS LVI. PAR. AND LXXIII. PARS. . ...PART II.CHAPTER XXIII. THE CHILD WITH THE MIRROR.NIETZSCHE TELLS US HERE IN A POETICAL FORM HOW DEEPLY GRIEVED HE WASBY THE MANIFOLD MISINTERPRETATIONS AND MISUNDERSTANDINGS WHICH WEREBECOMING RIFE CONCERNING HIS PUBLICATIONS. HE DOES NOT RECOGNISEHIMSELF IN THE MIRROR OF PUBLIC OPINION AND RECOILS TERRIFIED FROM THEDISTORTED REFLECTION OF HIS FEATURES. IN VERSE HE GIVES US AHINT WHICH IT WERE WELL NOT TO PASS OVER TOO LIGHTLY FOR IN THEINTRODUCTION TO THE GENEALOGY OF MORALS WRITTEN IN HE FINDS ITNECESSARY TO REFER TO THE MATTER AGAIN AND WITH GREATER PRECISION. THEPOINT IS THIS THAT A CREATOR OF NEW VALUES MEETS WITH HIS SUREST ANDSTRONGEST OBSTACLES IN THE VERY SPIRIT OF THE LANGUAGE WHICH IS AT HISDISPOSAL. WORDS LIKE ALL OTHER MANIFESTATIONS OF AN EVOLVING RACE ARESTAMPED WITH THE VALUES THAT HAVE LONG BEEN PARAMOUNT IN THAT RACE.NOW THE ORIGINAL THINKER WHO FINDS HIMSELF COMPELLED TO USE THE CURRENTSPEECH OF HIS COUNTRY IN ORDER TO IMPART NEW AND HITHERTO UNTRIED VIEWSTO HIS FELLOWS IMPOSES A TASK UPON THE NATURAL MEANS OF COMMUNICATIONWHICH IT IS TOTALLY UNFITTED TO PERFORMHENCE THE OBSCURITIES ANDPROLIXITIES WHICH ARE SO FREQUENTLY MET WITH IN THE WRITINGS OF ORIGINALTHINKERS. IN THE DAWN OF DAY NIETZSCHE ACTUALLY CAUTIONS YOUNGWRITERS AGAINST THE DANGER OF ALLOWING THEIR THOUGHTS TO BE MOULDED BYTHE WORDS AT THEIR DISPOSAL.CHAPTER XXIV. IN THE HAPPY ISLES.WHILE WRITING THIS NIETZSCHE IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN THINKING OF THEISLAND OF ISCHIA WHICH WAS ULTIMATELY DESTROYED BY AN EARTHQUAKE. HISTEACHING HERE IS QUITE CLEAR. HE WAS AMONG THE FIRST THINKERS OF EUROPETO OVERCOME THE PESSIMISM WHICH GODLESSNESS GENERALLY BRINGS IN ITSWAKE. HE POINTS TO CREATING AS THE SUREST SALVATION FROM THE SUFFERINGWHICH IS A CONCOMITANT OF ALL HIGHER LIFE. WHAT WOULD THERE BE TOCREATE HE ASKS IF THERE WEREGODS HIS IDEAL THE SUPERMAN LENDSHIM THE CHEERFULNESS NECESSARY TO THE OVERCOMING OF THAT DESPAIR USUALLYATTENDANT UPON GODLESSNESS AND UPON THE APPARENT AIMLESSNESS OF A WORLDWITHOUT A GOD.CHAPTER XXIX. THE TARANTULAS.THE TARANTULAS ARE THE SOCIALISTS AND DEMOCRATS. THIS DISCOURSE OFFERSUS AN ANALYSIS OF THEIR MENTAL ATTITUDE. NIETZSCHE REFUSES TO BECONFOUNDED WITH THOSE RESENTFUL AND REVENGEFUL ONES WHO CONDEMN SOCIETYFROM BELOW AND WHOSE CRITICISM IS ONLY SUPPRESSED ENVY. THERE ARETHOSE WHO PREACH MY DOCTRINE OF LIFE HE SAYS OF THE NIETZSCHEANSOCIALISTS AND ARE AT THE SAME TIME PREACHERS OF EQUALITY ANDTARANTULAS SEE NOTES ON CHAPTER XL. AND CHAPTER LI..CHAPTER XXX. THE FAMOUS WISE ONES.THIS REFERS TO ALL THOSE PHILOSOPHERS HITHERTO WHO HAVE RUN IN THEHARNESS OF ESTABLISHED VALUES AND HAVE NOT RISKED THEIR REPUTATION WITHTHE PEOPLE IN PURSUIT OF TRUTH. THE PHILOSOPHER HOWEVER AS NIETZSCHEUNDERSTOOD HIM IS A MAN WHO CREATES NEW VALUES AND THUS LEADS MANKINDIN A NEW DIRECTION.CHAPTER XXXIII. THE GRAVESONG.HERE ZARATHUSTRA SINGS ABOUT THE IDEALS AND FRIENDSHIPS OF HIS YOUTH.VERSES TO UNDOUBTEDLY REFER TO RICHARD WAGNER SEE NOTE ON CHAPTERLXV..CHAPTER XXXIV. SELFSURPASSING.IN THIS DISCOURSE WE GET THE BEST EXPOSITION IN THE WHOLE BOOK OFNIETZSCHES DOCTRINE OF THE WILL TO POWER. I GO INTO THIS QUESTIONTHOROUGHLY IN THE NOTE ON CHAPTER LVII.NIETZSCHE WAS NOT AN ICONOCLAST FROM CHOICE. THOSE WHO HASTILY CLASS HIMWITH THE ANARCHISTS OR THE PROGRESSIVISTS OF THE LAST CENTURY FAILTO UNDERSTAND THE HIGH ESTEEM IN WHICH HE ALWAYS HELD BOTH LAW ANDDISCIPLINE. IN VERSE OF THIS MOST DECISIVE DISCOURSE HE TRULYEXPLAINS HIS POSITION WHEN HE SAYS ...HE WHO HATH TO BE A CREATOR INGOOD AND EVILVERILY HE HATH FIRST TO BE A DESTROYER AND BREAK VALUESIN PIECES. THIS TEACHING IN REGARD TO SELFCONTROL IS EVIDENCE ENOUGHOF HIS REVERENCE FOR LAW.CHAPTER XXXV. THE SUBLIME ONES.THESE BELONG TO A TYPE WHICH NIETZSCHE DID NOT ALTOGETHER DISLIKE BUTWHICH HE WOULD FAIN HAVE RENDERED MORE SUBTLE AND PLASTIC. IT IS THETYPE THAT TAKES LIFE AND ITSELF TOO SERIOUSLY THAT NEVER SURMOUNTS THECAMELSTAGE MENTIONED IN THE FIRST DISCOURSE AND THAT IS OBDURATELYSUBLIME AND EARNEST. TO BE ABLE TO SMILE WHILE SPEAKING OF LOFTY THINGSAND NOT TO BE OPPRESSED BY THEM IS THE SECRET OF REAL GREATNESS. HEWHOSE HAND TREMBLES WHEN IT LAYS HOLD OF A BEAUTIFUL THING HAS THEQUALITY OF REVERENCE WITHOUT THE ARTISTS UNEMBARRASSED FRIENDSHIPWITH THE BEAUTIFUL. HENCE THE MISTAKES WHICH HAVE ARISEN IN REGARD TOCONFOUNDING NIETZSCHE WITH HIS EXTREME OPPOSITES THE ANARCHISTS ANDAGITATORS. FOR WHAT THEY DARE TO TOUCH AND BREAK WITH THE IMPUDENCEAND IRREVERENCE OF THE UNAPPRECIATIVE HE SEEMS LIKEWISE TO TOUCH ANDBREAKBUT WITH OTHER FINGERSWITH THE FINGERS OF THE LOVING ANDUNEMBARRASSED ARTIST WHO IS ON GOOD TERMS WITH THE BEAUTIFUL AND WHOFEELS ABLE TO CREATE IT AND TO ENHANCE IT WITH HIS TOUCH. THE QUESTIONOF TASTE PLAYS AN IMPORTANT PART IN NIETZSCHES PHILOSOPHY AND VERSES OF THIS DISCOURSE EXACTLY STATE NIETZSCHES ULTIMATE VIEWS ON THESUBJECT. IN THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY HE ACTUALLY CRIESNEITHER A GOODNOR A BAD TASTE BUT MY TASTE OF WHICH I HAVE NO LONGER EITHER SHAME ORSECRECY.CHAPTER XXXVI. THE LAND OF CULTURE.THIS IS A POETICAL EPITOME OF SOME OF THE SCATHING CRITICISM OFSCHOLARS WHICH APPEARS IN THE FIRST OF THE THOUGHTS OUT OF SEASONTHEPOLEMICAL PAMPHLET WRITTEN IN AGAINST DAVID STRAUSS AND HISSCHOOL. HE REPROACHES HIS FORMER COLLEAGUES WITH BEING STERILE ANDSHOWS THEM THAT THEIR STERILITY IS THE RESULT OF THEIR NOT BELIEVINGIN ANYTHING. HE WHO HAD TO CREATE HAD ALWAYS HIS PRESAGING DREAMS ANDASTRAL PREMONITIONSAND BELIEVED IN BELIEVING SEE NOTE ON CHAPTERLXXVII. IN THE LAST TWO VERSES HE REVEALS THE NATURE OF HIS ALTRUISM.HOW FAR IT DIFFERS FROM THAT OF CHRISTIANITY WE HAVE ALREADY READ IN THEDISCOURSE NEIGHBOURLOVE BUT HERE HE TELLS US DEFINITELY THE NATUREOF HIS LOVE TO MANKIND HE EXPLAINS WHY HE WAS COMPELLED TO ASSAIL THECHRISTIAN VALUES OF PITY AND EXCESSIVE LOVE OF THE NEIGHBOUR NOT ONLYBECAUSE THEY ARE SLAVEVALUES AND THEREFORE TEND TO PROMOTE DEGENERATIONSEE NOTE B. BUT BECAUSE HE COULD ONLY LOVE HIS CHILDRENS LAND THEUNDISCOVERED LAND IN A REMOTE SEA BECAUSE HE WOULD FAIN RETRIEVE THEERRORS OF HIS FATHERS IN HIS CHILDREN.CHAPTER XXXVII. IMMACULATE PERCEPTION.AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF NIETZSCHES INTERPRETATION OF LIFE IS DISCLOSEDIN THIS DISCOURSE. AS BUCKLE SUGGESTS IN HIS INFLUENCE OF WOMEN ON THEPROGRESS OF KNOWLEDGE THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT OF THE INVESTIGATOR ISBOTH HELPED AND SUPPLEMENTED BY THE LATTERS EMOTIONS AND PERSONALITYAND THE DIVORCE OF ALL EMOTIONALISM AND INDIVIDUAL TEMPERAMENT FROMSCIENCE IS A FATAL STEP TOWARDS STERILITY. ZARATHUSTRA ABJURES ALL THOSEWHO WOULD FAIN TURN AN IMPERSONAL EYE UPON NATURE AND CONTEMPLATE HERPHENOMENA WITH THAT PURE OBJECTIVITY TO WHICH THE SCIENTIFIC IDEALISTSOF TODAY WOULD SO MUCH LIKE TO ATTAIN. HE ACCUSES SUCH IDEALISTS OFHYPOCRISY AND GUILE HE SAYS THEY LACK INNOCENCE IN THEIR DESIRES ANDTHEREFORE SLANDER ALL DESIRING.CHAPTER XXXVIII. SCHOLARS.THIS IS A RECORD OF NIETZSCHES FINAL BREACH WITH HIS FORMERCOLLEAGUESTHE SCHOLARS OF GERMANY. ALREADY AFTER THE PUBLICATION OFTHE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY NUMBERS OF GERMAN PHILOLOGISTS AND PROFESSIONALPHILOSOPHERS HAD DENOUNCED HIM AS ONE WHO HAD STRAYED TOO FAR FROMTHEIR FLOCK AND HIS LECTURES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BALE WERE DESERTEDIN CONSEQUENCE BUT IT WAS NOT UNTIL WHEN HE FINALLY SEVERED ALLCONNECTION WITH UNIVERSITY WORK THAT HE MAY BE SAID TO HAVE ATTAINED TOTHE FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE WHICH STAMP THIS DISCOURSE.CHAPTER XXXIX. POETS.PEOPLE HAVE SOMETIMES SAID THAT NIETZSCHE HAD NO SENSE OF HUMOUR. IHAVE NO INTENTION OF DEFENDING HIM HERE AGAINST SUCH FOOLISH CRITICS ISHOULD ONLY LIKE TO POINT OUT TO THE READER THAT WE HAVE HIM HERE ATHIS BEST POKING FUN AT HIMSELF AND AT HIS FELLOWPOETS SEE NOTE ONCHAPTER LXIII. PARS. .CHAPTER XL. GREAT EVENTS.HERE WE SEEM TO HAVE A PUZZLE. ZARATHUSTRA HIMSELF WHILE RELATINGHIS EXPERIENCE WITH THE FIREDOG TO HIS DISCIPLES FAILS TO GET THEMINTERESTED IN HIS NARRATIVE AND WE ALSO MAY BE ONLY TOO READY TO TURNOVER THESE PAGES UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY ARE LITTLE MORE THANA MERE PHANTASY OR POETICAL FLIGHT. ZARATHUSTRAS INTERVIEW WITH THEFIREDOG IS HOWEVER OF GREAT IMPORTANCE. IN IT WE FIND NIETZSCHEFACE TO FACE WITH THE CREATURE HE MOST SINCERELY LOATHESTHE SPIRITOF REVOLUTION AND WE OBTAIN FRESH HINTS CONCERNING HIS HATRED OF THEANARCHIST AND REBEL. FREEDOM YE ALL ROAR MOST EAGERLY HE SAYS TOTHE FIREDOG BUT I HAVE UNLEARNED THE BELIEF IN GREAT EVENTS WHENTHERE IS MUCH ROARING AND SMOKE ABOUT THEM. NOT AROUND THE INVENTORSOF NEW NOISE BUT AROUND THE INVENTORS OF NEW VALUES DOTH THE WORLDREVOLVE INAUDIBLY IT REVOLVETH.CHAPTER XLI. THE SOOTHSAYER.THIS REFERS OF COURSE TO SCHOPENHAUER. NIETZSCHE AS IS WELL KNOWNWAS AT ONE TIME AN ARDENT FOLLOWER OF SCHOPENHAUER. HE OVERCAMEPESSIMISM BY DISCOVERING AN OBJECT IN EXISTENCE HE SAW THE POSSIBILITYOF RAISING SOCIETY TO A HIGHER LEVEL AND PREACHED THE PROFOUNDESTOPTIMISM IN CONSEQUENCE.CHAPTER XLII. REDEMPTION.ZARATHUSTRA HERE ADDRESSES CRIPPLES. HE TELLS THEM OF OTHERCRIPPLESTHE GREAT MEN IN THIS WORLD WHO HAVE ONE ORGAN OR FACULTYINORDINATELY DEVELOPED AT THE COST OF THEIR OTHER FACULTIES. THIS ISDOUBTLESS A REFERENCE TO A FACT WHICH IS TOO OFTEN NOTICEABLE IN THECASE OF SO MANY OF THE WORLDS GIANTS IN ART SCIENCE OR RELIGION. INVERSE WE ARE TOLD WHAT NIETZSCHE CALLED REDEMPTIONTHAT IS TO SAYTHE ABILITY TO SAY OF ALL THAT IS PAST THUS WOULD I HAVE IT. THEIN ABILITY TO SAY THIS AND THE RESENTMENT WHICH RESULTS THEREFROMHE REGARDS AS THE SOURCE OF ALL OUR FEELINGS OF REVENGE AND ALL OURDESIRES TO PUNISHPUNISHMENT MEANING TO HIM MERELY A EUPHEMISM FOR THEWORD REVENGE INVENTED IN ORDER TO STILL OUR CONSCIENCES. HE WHO CAN BEPROUD OF HIS ENEMIES WHO CAN BE GRATEFUL TO THEM FOR THE OBSTACLES THEYHAVE PUT IN HIS WAY HE WHO CAN REGARD HIS WORST CALAMITY AS BUT THEEXTRA STRAIN ON THE BOW OF HIS LIFE WHICH IS TO SEND THE ARROW OFHIS LONGING EVEN FURTHER THAN HE COULD HAVE HOPEDTHIS MAN KNOWS NOREVENGE NEITHER DOES HE KNOW DESPAIR HE TRULY HAS FOUND REDEMPTION ANDCAN TURN ON THE WORST IN HIS LIFE AND EVEN IN HIMSELF AND CALL IT HISBEST SEE NOTES ON CHAPTER LVII..CHAPTER XLIII. MANLY PRUDENCE.THIS DISCOURSE IS VERY IMPORTANT. IN BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL WE HEAROFTEN ENOUGH THAT THE SELECT AND SUPERIOR MAN MUST WEAR A MASK ANDHERE WE FIND THIS INJUNCTION EXPLAINED. AND HE WHO WOULD NOT LANGUISHAMONGST MEN MUST LEARN TO DRINK OUT OF ALL GLASSES AND HE WHO WOULDKEEP CLEAN AMONGST MEN MUST KNOW HOW TO WASH HIMSELF EVEN WITH DIRTYWATER. THIS I VENTURE TO SUGGEST REQUIRES SOME EXPLANATION. AT A TIMEWHEN INDIVIDUALITY IS SUPPOSED TO BE SHOWN MOST TELLINGLY BY PUTTINGBOOTS ON ONES HANDS AND GLOVES ON ONES FEET IT IS SOMEWHAT REFRESHINGTO COME ACROSS A TRUE INDIVIDUALIST WHO FEELS THE CHASM BETWEEN HIMSELFAND OTHERS SO DEEPLY THAT HE MUST PERFORCE ADAPT HIMSELF TO THEMOUTWARDLY AT LEAST IN ALL RESPECTS SO THAT THE INNER DIFFERENCESHOULD BE OVERLOOKED. NIETZSCHE PRACTICALLY TELLS US HERE THAT IT IS NOTHE WHO INTENTIONALLY WEARS ECCENTRIC CLOTHES OR DOES ECCENTRIC THINGSWHO IS TRULY THE INDIVIDUALIST. THE PROFOUND MAN WHO IS BY NATUREDIFFERENTIATED FROM HIS FELLOWS FEELS THIS DIFFERENCE TOO KEENLY TOCALL ATTENTION TO IT BY ANY OUTWARD SHOW. HE IS SHAMEFAST AND BASHFULWITH THOSE WHO SURROUND HIM AND WISHES NOT TO BE DISCOVERED BY THEMJUST AS ONE INSTINCTIVELY AVOIDS ALL LAVISH DISPLAY OF COMFORT OR WEALTHIN THE PRESENCE OF A POOR FRIEND.CHAPTER XLIV. THE STILLEST HOUR.THIS SEEMS TO ME TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT STRUGGLE WHICH MUSTHAVE TAKEN PLACE IN NIETZSCHES SOUL BEFORE HE FINALLY RESOLVED TO MAKEKNOWN THE MORE ESOTERIC PORTIONS OF HIS TEACHING. OUR DEEPEST FEELINGSCRAVE SILENCE. THERE IS A CERTAIN SELFRESPECT IN THE SERIOUS MAN WHICHMAKES HIM HOLD HIS PROFOUNDEST FEELINGS SACRED. BEFORE THEY ARE UTTEREDTHEY ARE FULL OF THE MODESTY OF A VIRGIN AND OFTEN THE OLDEST SAGE WILLBLUSH LIKE A GIRL WHEN THIS VIRGINITY IS VIOLATED BY AN INDISCRETIONWHICH FORCES HIM TO REVEAL HIS DEEPEST THOUGHTS. ...PART III.THIS IS PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL THE FOUR PARTS. IF ITCONTAINED ONLY THE VISION AND THE ENIGMA AND THE OLD AND NEW TABLES I SHOULD STILL BE OF THIS OPINION FOR IN THE FORMER OF THESE DISCOURSESWE MEET WITH WHAT NIETZSCHE REGARDED AS THE CROWNING DOCTRINE OF HISPHILOSOPHY AND IN THE OLD AND NEW TABLES WE HAVE A VALUABLE EPITOME OFPRACTICALLY ALL HIS LEADING PRINCIPLES.CHAPTER XLVI. THE VISION AND THE ENIGMA.THE VISION AND THE ENIGMA IS PERHAPS AN EXAMPLE OF NIETZSCHE IN HISMOST OBSCURE VEIN. WE MUST KNOW HOW PERSISTENTLY HE INVEIGHED AGAINSTTHE OPPRESSING AND DEPRESSING INFLUENCE OF MANS SENSE OF GUILT ANDCONSCIOUSNESS OF SIN IN ORDER FULLY TO GRASP THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THISDISCOURSE. SLOWLY BUT SURELY HE THOUGHT THE VALUES OF CHRISTIANITY ANDJUDAIC TRADITIONS HAD DONE THEIR WORK IN THE MINDS OF MEN. WHAT WEREONCE BUT EXPEDIENTS DEVISED FOR THE DISCIPLINE OF A CERTAIN PORTION OFHUMANITY HAD NOW PASSED INTO MANS BLOOD AND HAD BECOME INSTINCTS. THISOPPRESSIVE AND PARALYSING SENSE OF GUILT AND OF SIN IS WHAT NIETZSCHEREFERS TO WHEN HE SPEAKS OF THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY. THIS CREATUREHALFDWARF HALFMOLE WHOM HE BEARS WITH HIM A CERTAIN DISTANCE ON HISCLIMB AND FINALLY DEFIES AND WHOM HE CALLS HIS DEVIL AND ARCHENEMY ISNOTHING MORE THAN THE HEAVY MILLSTONE GUILTY CONSCIENCE TOGETHER WITHTHE CONCEPT OF SIN WHICH AT PRESENT HANGS ROUND THE NECK OF MEN. TO RISEABOVE ITTO SOARIS THE MOST DIFFICULT OF ALL THINGS TODAY. NIETZSCHEIS ABLE TO THINK CHEERFULLY AND OPTIMISTICALLY OF THE POSSIBILITY OFLIFE IN THIS WORLD RECURRING AGAIN AND AGAIN WHEN HE HAS ONCE CAST THEDWARF FROM HIS SHOULDERS AND HE ANNOUNCES HIS DOCTRINE OF THE ETERNALRECURRENCE OF ALL THINGS GREAT AND SMALL TO HIS ARCHENEMY AND INDEFIANCE OF HIM.THAT THERE IS MUCH TO BE SAID FOR NIETZSCHES HYPOTHESIS OF THE ETERNALRECURRENCE OF ALL THINGS GREAT AND SMALL NOBODY WHO HAS READ THELITERATURE ON THE SUBJECT WILL DOUBT FOR AN INSTANT BUT IT REMAINS AVERY DARING CONJECTURE NOTWITHSTANDING AND EVEN IN ITS ULTIMATE EFFECTAS A DOGMA ON THE MINDS OF MEN I VENTURE TO DOUBT WHETHER NIETZSCHEEVER PROPERLY ESTIMATED ITS WORTH SEE NOTE ON CHAPTER LVII..WHAT FOLLOWS IS CLEAR ENOUGH. ZARATHUSTRA SEES A YOUNG SHEPHERDSTRUGGLING ON THE GROUND WITH A SNAKE HOLDING FAST TO THE BACK OF HISTHROAT. THE SAGE ASSUMING THAT THE SNAKE MUST HAVE CRAWLED INTO THEYOUNG MANS MOUTH WHILE HE LAY SLEEPING RUNS TO HIS HELP AND PULLSAT THE LOATHSOME REPTILE WITH ALL HIS MIGHT BUT IN VAIN. AT LAST INDESPAIR ZARATHUSTRA APPEALS TO THE YOUNG MANS WILL. KNOWING FULL WELLWHAT A GHASTLY OPERATION HE IS RECOMMENDING HE NEVERTHELESS CRIESBITE BITE ITS HEAD OFF BITE AS THE ONLY POSSIBLE SOLUTION OF THEDIFFICULTY. THE YOUNG SHEPHERD BITES AND FAR AWAY HE SPITS THESNAKES HEAD WHEREUPON HE RISES NO LONGER SHEPHERD NO LONGER MANATRANSFIGURED BEING A LIGHTSURROUNDED BEING THAT LAUGHED NEVER ONEARTH LAUGHED A MAN AS HE LAUGHEDIN THIS PARABLE THE YOUNG SHEPHERD IS OBVIOUSLY THE MAN OF TODAY THESNAKE THAT CHOKES HIM REPRESENTS THE STULTIFYING AND PARALYSING SOCIALVALUES THAT THREATEN TO SHATTER HUMANITY AND THE ADVICE BITE BITE IS BUT NIETZSCHES EXASPERATED CRY TO MANKIND TO ALTER THEIR VALUESBEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.CHAPTER XLVII. INVOLUNTARY BLISS.THIS LIKE THE WANDERER IS ONE OF THE MANY INTROSPECTIVE PASSAGESIN THE WORK AND IS FULL OF INNUENDOS AND HINTS AS TO THE NIETZSCHEANOUTLOOK ON LIFE.CHAPTER XLVIII. BEFORE SUNRISE.HERE WE HAVE A RECORD OF ZARATHUSTRAS AVOWAL OF OPTIMISM AS ALSO THEIMPORTANT STATEMENT CONCERNING CHANCE OR ACCIDENT VERSE . THOSEWHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH NIETZSCHES PHILOSOPHY WILL NOT REQUIRE TO BE TOLDWHAT AN IMPORTANT ROLE HIS DOCTRINE OF CHANCE PLAYS IN HIS TEACHING.THE GIANT CHANCE HAS HITHERTO PLAYED WITH THE PUPPET MANTHIS ISTHE FACT HE CANNOT CONTEMPLATE WITH EQUANIMITY. MAN SHALL NOW EXPLOITCHANCE HE SAYS AGAIN AND AGAIN AND MAKE IT FALL ON ITS KNEES BEFOREHIM SEE VERSE IN ON THE OLIVEMOUNT AND VERSES IN THEBEDWARFING VIRTUE.CHAPTER XLIX. THE BEDWARFING VIRTUE.THIS REQUIRES SCARCELY ANY COMMENT. IT IS A SATIRE ON MODERN MAN ANDHIS BELITTLING VIRTUES. IN VERSES AND OF THE SECOND PART OF THEDISCOURSE WE ARE REMINDED OF NIETZSCHES POWERFUL INDICTMENT OF THEGREAT OF TODAY IN THE ANTICHRIST APHORISM AT PRESENTNOBODY HAS ANY LONGER THE COURAGE FOR SEPARATE RIGHTS FOR RIGHTS OFDOMINATION FOR A FEELING OF REVERENCE FOR HIMSELF AND HIS EQUALSFORPATHOS OF DISTANCE.... OUR POLITICS ARE MORBID FROM THIS WANT OFCOURAGETHE ARISTOCRACY OF CHARACTER HAS BEEN UNDERMINED MOST CRAFTILYBY THE LIE OF THE EQUALITY OF SOULS AND IF THE BELIEF IN THE PRIVILEGEOF THE MANY MAKES REVOLUTIONS AND WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE THEM IT ISCHRISTIANITY LET US NOT DOUBT IT IT IS CHRISTIAN VALUATIONS WHICHTRANSLATE EVERY REVOLUTION MERELY INTO BLOOD AND CRIME SEE ALSOBEYOND GOOD AND EVIL PAGES . NIETZSCHE THOUGHT IT WAS ABAD SIGN OF THE TIMES THAT EVEN RULERS HAVE LOST THE COURAGE OFTHEIR POSITIONS AND THAT A MAN OF FREDERICK THE GREATS POWER ANDDISTINGUISHED GIFTS SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SAY ICH BIN DER ERSTEDIENER DES STAATES I AM THE FIRST SERVANT OF THE STATE. TO THISUTTERANCE OF THE GREAT SOVEREIGN VERSE UNDOUBTEDLY REFERS.COWARDICE AND MEDIOCRITY ARE THE NAMES WITH WHICH HE LABELS MODERNNOTIONS OF VIRTUE AND MODERATION.IN PART III. WE GET THE SENTIMENTS OF THE DISCOURSE IN THE HAPPYISLES BUT PERHAPS IN STRONGER TERMS. ONCE AGAIN WE FIND NIETZSCHETHOROUGHLY AT EASE IF NOT CHEERFUL AS AN ATHEIST AND SPEAKING WITHVERTIGINOUS DARING OF MAKING CHANCE GO ON ITS KNEES TO HIM. IN VERSE ZARATHUSTRA MAKES YET ANOTHER ATTEMPT AT DEFINING HIS ENTIRELYANTIANARCHICAL ATTITUDE AND UNLESS SUCH PASSAGES HAVE BEEN COMPLETELYOVERLOOKED OR DELIBERATELY IGNORED HITHERTO BY THOSE WHO WILL PERSIST INLAYING ANARCHY AT HIS DOOR IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW HE EVERBECAME ASSOCIATED WITH THAT FOUL POLITICAL PARTY.THE LAST VERSE INTRODUCES THE EXPRESSION THE GREAT NOONTIDE IN THEPOEM TO BE FOUND AT THE END OF BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL WE MEET WITHTHE EXPRESSION AGAIN AND WE SHALL FIND IT OCCURRING TIME AND AGAIN INNIETZSCHES WORKS. IT WILL BE FOUND FULLY ELUCIDATED IN THE FIFTH PARTOF THE TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS BUT FOR THOSE WHO CANNOT REFER TOTHIS BOOK IT WERE WELL TO POINT OUT THAT NIETZSCHE CALLED THE PRESENTPERIODOUR PERIODTHE NOON OF MANS HISTORY. DAWN IS BEHIND US. THECHILDHOOD OF MANKIND IS OVER. NOW WE KNOW THERE IS NOW NO LONGER ANYEXCUSE FOR MISTAKES WHICH WILL TEND TO BOTCH AND DISFIGURE THE TYPE MAN.WITH RESPECT TO WHAT IS PAST HE SAYS I HAVE LIKE ALL DISCERNINGONES GREAT TOLERATION THAT IS TO SAY GENEROUS SELFCONTROL.... BUT MYFEELING CHANGES SUDDENLY AND BREAKS OUT AS SOON AS I ENTER THE MODERNPERIOD OUR PERIOD. OUR AGE KNOWS... SEE NOTE ON CHAPTER LXX..CHAPTER LI. ON PASSINGBY.HERE WE FIND NIETZSCHE CONFRONTED WITH HIS EXTREME OPPOSITE WITHHIM THEREFORE FOR WHOM HE IS MOST FREQUENTLY MISTAKEN BY THE UNWARY.ZARATHUSTRAS APE HE IS CALLED IN THE DISCOURSE. HE IS ONE OF THOSEAT WHOSE HANDS NIETZSCHE HAD TO SUFFER MOST DURING HIS LIFETIME ANDAT WHOSE HANDS HIS PHILOSOPHY HAS SUFFERED MOST SINCE HIS DEATH. IN THISRESPECT IT MAY SEEM A LITTLE TRIVIAL TO SPEAK OF EXTREMES MEETING BUTIT IS WONDERFULLY APT. MANY HAVE ADOPTED NIETZSCHES MANNERISMS ANDWORDCOINAGES WHO HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH HIM BEYOND THE IDEAS ANDBUSINESS THEY PLAGIARISED BUT THE SUPERFICIAL OBSERVER AND A LARGEPORTION OF THE PUBLIC NOT KNOWING OF THESE THINGSNOT KNOWING PERHAPSTHAT THERE ARE ICONOCLASTS WHO DESTROY OUT OF LOVE AND ARE THEREFORECREATORS AND THAT THERE ARE OTHERS WHO DESTROY OUT OF RESENTMENT ANDREVENGEFULNESS AND WHO ARE THEREFORE REVOLUTIONISTS AND ANARCHISTSAREPRONE TO CONFOUND THE TWO TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE NOBLER TYPE.IF WE NOW READ WHAT THE FOOL SAYS TO ZARATHUSTRA AND NOTE THE TRICKS OFSPEECH HE HAS BORROWED FROM HIM IF WE CAREFULLY FOLLOW THE ATTITUDEHE ASSUMES WE SHALL UNDERSTAND WHY ZARATHUSTRA FINALLY INTERRUPTS HIM.STOP THIS AT ONCE ZARATHUSTRA CRIES LONG HAVE THY SPEECH ANDTHY SPECIES DISGUSTED ME.... OUT OF LOVE ALONE SHALL MY CONTEMPT AND MYWARNING BIRD TAKE WING BUT NOT OUT OF THE SWAMP IT WERE WELL IFTHIS DISCOURSE WERE TAKEN TO HEART BY ALL THOSE WHO ARE TOO READY TOASSOCIATE NIETZSCHE WITH LESSER AND NOISER MENWITH MOUNTEBANKS ANDMUMMERS.CHAPTER LII. THE APOSTATES.IT IS CLEAR THAT THIS APPLIES TO ALL THOSE BREATHLESS AND HASTY TASTERSOF EVERYTHING WHO PLUNGE TOO RASHLY INTO THE SEA OF INDEPENDENTTHOUGHT AND HERESY AND WHO HAVING MISCALCULATED THEIR STRENGTH FINDIT IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP THEIR HEAD ABOVE WATER. A LITTLE OLDER A LITTLECOLDER SAYS NIETZSCHE. THEY SOON CLAMBER BACK TO THE CONVENTIONS OFTHE AGE THEY INTENDED REFORMING. THE FRENCH THEN SAY LE DIABLE SE FAITHERMITE BUT THESE MEN AS A RULE HAVE NEVER BEEN DEVILS NEITHERDO THEY BECOME ANGELS FOR IN ORDER TO BE REALLY GOOD OR EVIL SOMESTRENGTH AND DEEP BREATHING IS REQUIRED. THOSE WHO ARE MORE INTERESTEDIN SUPPORTING ORTHODOXY THAN IN BEING OVER NICE CONCERNING THE KIND OFSUPPORT THEY GIVE IT OFTEN REFER TO THESE PEOPLE AS EVIDENCE IN FAVOUROF THE TRUE FAITH.CHAPTER LIII. THE RETURN HOME.THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A CLASS OF WRITING WHICH MAY BE PASSED OVER TOOLIGHTLY BY THOSE WHOM POETASTERS HAVE MADE DISTRUSTFUL OF POETRY. FROMFIRST TO LAST IT IS EXTREMELY VALUABLE AS AN AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL NOTE. THEINEVITABLE SUPERFICIALITY OF THE RABBLE IS CONTRASTED WITH THE PEACEFULAND PROFOUND DEPTHS OF THE ANCHORITE. HERE WE FIRST GET A DIRECT HINTCONCERNING NIETZSCHES FUNDAMENTAL PASSIONTHE MAIN FORCE BEHIND ALLHIS NEW VALUES AND SCATHING CRITICISM OF EXISTING VALUES. IN VERSE WE ARE TOLD THAT PITY WAS HIS GREATEST DANGER. THE BROAD ALTRUISM OF THELAWGIVER THINKING OVER VAST ERAS OF TIME WAS CONTINUALLY BEING PITTEDBY NIETZSCHE IN HIMSELF AGAINST THAT TRANSIENT AND MEANER SYMPATHY FORTHE NEIGHBOUR WHICH HE MORE PERHAPS THAN ANY OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES HADSUFFERED FROM BUT WHICH HE WAS CERTAIN INVOLVED ENORMOUS DANGERS NOTONLY FOR HIMSELF BUT ALSO TO THE NEXT AND SUBSEQUENT GENERATIONS SEENOTE B. WHERE PITY IS MENTIONED AMONG THE DEGENERATE VIRTUES. LATERIN THE BOOK WE SHALL SEE HOW HIS PROFOUND COMPASSION LEADS HIM INTOTEMPTATION AND HOW FRANTICALLY HE STRUGGLES AGAINST IT. IN VERSES AND HE TELLS US TO WHAT EXTENT HE HAD TO MODIFY HIMSELF IN ORDERTO BE ENDURED BY HIS FELLOWS WHOM HE LOVED SEE ALSO VERSE IN MANLYPRUDENCE. NIETZSCHES GREAT LOVE FOR HIS FELLOWS WHICH HE CONFESSESIN THE PROLOGUE AND WHICH IS AT THE ROOT OF ALL HIS TEACHING SEEMSRATHER TO ELUDE THE DISCERNING POWERS OF THE AVERAGE PHILANTHROPIST ANDMODERN MAN. HE CANNOT SEE THE WOOD FOR THE TREES. A PHILANTHROPY THATSACRIFICES THE MINORITY OF THE PRESENTDAY FOR THE MAJORITY CONSTITUTINGPOSTERITY COMPLETELY EVADES HIS MENTAL GRASP AND NIETZSCHESPHILOSOPHY BECAUSE IT DECLARES CHRISTIAN VALUES TO BE A DANGER TO THEFUTURE OF OUR KIND IS THEREFORE SHELVED AS BRUTAL COLD AND HARD SEENOTE ON CHAPTER XXXVI.. NIETZSCHE TRIED TO BE ALL THINGS TO ALL MENHE WAS SUFFICIENTLY FOND OF HIS FELLOWS FOR THAT IN THE RETURN HOME HEDESCRIBES HOW HE ULTIMATELY RETURNS TO LONELINESS IN ORDER TO RECOVERFROM THE EFFECTS OF HIS EXPERIMENT.CHAPTER LIV. THE THREE EVIL THINGS.NIETZSCHE IS HERE COMPLETELY IN HIS ELEMENT. THREE THINGS HITHERTOBEST CURSED AND MOST CALUMNIATED ON EARTH ARE BROUGHT FORWARD TO BEWEIGHED. VOLUPTUOUSNESS THIRST OF POWER AND SELFISHNESSTHE THREEFORCES IN HUMANITY WHICH CHRISTIANITY HAS DONE MOST TO GARBLE ANDBESMIRCHNIETZSCHE ENDEAVOURS TO REINSTATE IN THEIR FORMER PLACES OFHONOUR. VOLUPTUOUSNESS OR SENSUAL PLEASURE IS A DANGEROUS THING TODISCUSS NOWADAYS. IF WE MENTION IT WITH FAVOUR WE MAY BE REGARDEDHOWEVER UNJUSTLY AS THE ADVOCATE OF SAVAGES SATYRS AND PURESENSUALITY. IF WE CONDEMN IT WE EITHER GO OVER TO THE PURITANS OR WEJOIN THOSE WHO ARE WONT TO COME TO TABLE WITH NO EDGE TO THEIR APPETITESAND WHO THEREFORE GRUMBLE AT ALL GOOD FARE. THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THATTHE VALUE OF HEALTHY INNOCENT VOLUPTUOUSNESS LIKE THE VALUE OF HEALTHITSELF MUST HAVE BEEN GREATLY DISCOUNTED BY ALL THOSE WHO RESENTINGTHEIR INABILITY TO PARTAKE OF THIS WORLDS GOODS CRIED LIKE ST PAULI WOULD THAT ALL MEN WERE EVEN AS I MYSELF. NOW NIETZSCHES PHILOSOPHYMIGHT BE CALLED AN ATTEMPT AT GIVING BACK TO HEALTHY AND NORMAL MENINNOCENCE AND A CLEAN CONSCIENCE IN THEIR DESIRESNOT TO APPLAUD THEVULGAR SENSUALISTS WHO RESPOND TO EVERY STIMULUS AND WHOSE PASSIONS AREOUT OF HAND NOT TO TELL THE MEAN SELFISH INDIVIDUAL WHOSE SELFISHNESSIS A POLLUTION SEE APHORISM TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS THAT HE ISRIGHT NOR TO ASSURE THE WEAK THE SICK AND THE CRIPPLED THAT THETHIRST OF POWER WHICH THEY GRATIFY BY EXPLOITING THE HAPPIER ANDHEALTHIER INDIVIDUALS IS JUSTIFIEDBUT TO SAVE THE CLEAN HEALTHY MANFROM THE VALUES OF THOSE AROUND HIM WHO LOOK AT EVERYTHING THROUGH THEMUD THAT IS IN THEIR OWN BODIESTO GIVE HIM AND HIM ALONE A CLEANCONSCIENCE IN HIS MANHOOD AND THE DESIRES OF HIS MANHOOD. DO I COUNSELYOU TO SLAY YOUR INSTINCTS I COUNSEL TO INNOCENCE IN YOUR INSTINCTS. IN VERSE OF THE SECOND PARAGRAPH AS IN VERSE I OF PARAGRAPH INTHE OLD AND NEW TABLES NIETZSCHE GIVES US A REASON FOR HIS OCCASIONALOBSCURITY SEE ALSO VERSES TO OF POETS. AS I HAVE ALREADY POINTEDOUT HIS PHILOSOPHY IS QUITE ESOTERIC. IT CAN SERVE NO PURPOSE WITH THEORDINARY MEDIOCRE TYPE OF MAN. I PERSONALLY CAN NO LONGER HAVE ANYDOUBT THAT NIETZSCHES ONLY OBJECT IN THAT PART OF HIS PHILOSOPHY WHEREHE BIDS HIS FRIENDS STAND BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL WITH HIM WAS TO SAVEHIGHER MEN WHOSE GROWTH AND SCOPE MIGHT BE LIMITED BY THE TOOSTRICT OBSERVANCE OF MODERN VALUES FROM FOUNDERING ON THE ROCKS OF ACOMPROMISE BETWEEN THEIR OWN GENIUS AND TRADITIONAL CONVENTIONS. THEONLY POSSIBLE WAY IN WHICH THE GREAT MAN CAN ACHIEVE GREATNESS ISBY MEANS OF EXCEPTIONAL FREEDOMTHE FREEDOM WHICH ASSISTS HIM INEXPERIENCING HIMSELF. VERSES TO AFFORD AN EXCELLENT SUPPLEMENT TONIETZSCHES DESCRIPTION OF THE ATTITUDE OF THE NOBLE TYPE TOWARDS THESLAVES IN APHORISM OF THE WORK BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL SEE ALSO NOTEB.CHAPTER LV. THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY.SEE NOTE ON CHAPTER XLVI. IN PART II. OF THIS DISCOURSE WE MEET WITHA DOCTRINE NOT TOUCHED UPON HITHERTO SAVE INDIRECTLYI REFER TO THEDOCTRINE OF SELFLOVE. WE SHOULD TRY TO UNDERSTAND THIS PERFECTLY BEFOREPROCEEDING FOR IT IS PRECISELY VIEWS OF THIS SORT WHICH AFTER HAVINGBEEN CUT OUT OF THE ORIGINAL CONTEXT ARE REPEATED FAR AND WIDE ASINTERNAL EVIDENCE PROVING THE GENERAL UNSOUNDNESS OF NIETZSCHESPHILOSOPHY. ALREADY IN THE LAST OF THE THOUGHTS OUT OF SEASON NIETZSCHE SPEAKS AS FOLLOWS ABOUT MODERN MEN ...THESE MODERN CREATURESWISH RATHER TO BE HUNTED DOWN WOUNDED AND TORN TO SHREDS THAN TOLIVE ALONE WITH THEMSELVES IN SOLITARY CALM. ALONE WITH ONESELFTHISTHOUGHT TERRIFIES THE MODERN SOUL IT IS HIS ONE ANXIETY HIS ONEGHASTLY FEAR ENGLISH EDITION PAGE . IN HIS FEVERISH SCURRY TOFIND ENTERTAINMENT AND DIVERSION WHETHER IN A NOVEL A NEWSPAPER OR APLAY THE MODERN MAN CONDEMNS HIS OWN AGE UTTERLY FOR HE SHOWS THAT INHIS HEART OF HEARTS HE DESPISES HIMSELF. ONE CANNOT CHANGE A CONDITIONOF THIS SORT IN A DAY TO BECOME ENDURABLE TO ONESELF AN INNERTRANSFORMATION IS NECESSARY. TOO LONG HAVE WE LOST OURSELVES IN OURFRIENDS AND ENTERTAINMENTS TO BE ABLE TO FIND OURSELVES SO SOON ATANOTHERS BIDDING. AND VERILY IT IS NO COMMANDMENT FOR TODAY ANDTOMORROW TO LEARN TO LOVE ONESELF. RATHER IS IT OF ALL ARTS THE FINESTSUBTLEST LAST AND PATIENTEST.IN THE LAST VERSE NIETZSCHE CHALLENGES US TO SHOW THAT OUR WAY ISTHE RIGHT WAY. IN HIS TEACHING HE DOES NOT COERCE US NOR DOES HEOVERPERSUADE HE SIMPLY SAYS I AM A LAW ONLY FOR MINE OWN I AM NOT ALAW FOR ALL. THISIS NOW MY WAYWHERE IS YOURSCHAPTER LVI. OLD AND NEW TABLES. PAR. .NIETZSCHE HIMSELF DECLARES THIS TO BE THE MOST DECISIVE PORTION OFTHE WHOLE OF THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA. IT IS A SORT OF EPITOME OF HISLEADING DOCTRINES. IN VERSE OF THE SECOND PARAGRAPH WE LEARN HOW HEHIMSELF WOULD FAIN HAVE ABANDONED THE POETICAL METHOD OF EXPRESSION HADHE NOT KNOWN ONLY TOO WELL THAT THE ONLY CHANCE A NEW DOCTRINE HAS OFSURVIVING NOWADAYS DEPENDS UPON ITS BEING GIVEN TO THE WORLD IN SOMEKIND OF ARTFORM. JUST AS PROPHETS CENTURIES AGO OFTEN HAD TO HAVERECOURSE TO THE MASK OF MADNESS IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE HATRED OF THOSEWHO DID NOT AND COULD NOT SEE AS THEY DID SO TODAY THE STRUGGLE FOREXISTENCE AMONG OPINIONS AND VALUES IS SO GREAT THAT AN ARTFORMIS PRACTICALLY THE ONLY GARB IN WHICH A NEW PHILOSOPHY CAN DARE TOINTRODUCE ITSELF TO US.PARS. AND .MANY OF THE PARAGRAPHS WILL BE FOUND TO BE MERELY REMINISCENT OF FORMERDISCOURSES. FOR INSTANCE PAR. RECALLS REDEMPTION. THE LAST VERSEOF PAR. IS IMPORTANT. FREEDOM WHICH AS I HAVE POINTED OUT BEFORENIETZSCHE CONSIDERED A DANGEROUS ACQUISITION IN INEXPERIENCED ORUNWORTHY HANDS HERE RECEIVES ITS DEATHBLOW AS A GENERAL DESIDERATUM.IN THE FIRST PART WE READ UNDER THE WAY OF THE CREATING ONE THATFREEDOM AS AN END IN ITSELF DOES NOT CONCERN ZARATHUSTRA AT ALL. HE SAYSTHERE FREE FROM WHAT WHAT DOTH THAT MATTER TO ZARATHUSTRA CLEARLYHOWEVER SHALL THINE EYE ANSWER ME FREE FOR WHAT AND IN THEBEDWARFING VIRTUE AH THAT YE UNDERSTOOD MY WORD DO EVER WHAT YEWILLBUT FIRST BE SUCH AS CAN WILL.PAR. .HERE WE HAVE A DESCRIPTION OF THE KIND OF ALTRUISM NIETZSCHE EXACTEDFROM HIGHER MEN. IT IS REALLY A COMMENT UPON THE BESTOWING VIRTUE SEENOTE ON CHAPTER XXII..PAR. .THIS REFERS OF COURSE TO THE RECEPTION PIONEERS OF NIETZSCHES STAMPMEET WITH AT THE HANDS OF THEIR CONTEMPORARIES.PAR. .NIETZSCHE TEACHES THAT NOTHING IS STABLENOT EVEN VALUESNOTEVEN THE CONCEPTS GOOD AND EVIL. HE LIKENS LIFE UNTO A STREAM. BUTFOOTBRIDGES AND RAILINGS SPAN THE STREAM AND THEY SEEM TO STANDFIRM. MANY WILL BE REMINDED OF GOOD AND EVIL WHEN THEY LOOK UPON THESESTRUCTURES FOR THUS THESE SAME VALUES STAND OVER THE STREAM OF LIFEAND LIFE FLOWS ON BENEATH THEM AND LEAVES THEM STANDING. WHEN HOWEVERWINTER COMES AND THE STREAM GETS FROZEN MANY INQUIRE SHOULD NOTEVERYTHINGSTAND STILL FUNDAMENTALLY EVERYTHING STANDETH STILL. BUTSOON THE SPRING COMETH AND WITH IT THE THAWWIND. IT BREAKS THE ICE ANDTHE ICE BREAKS DOWN THE FOOTBRIDGES AND RAILINGS WHEREUPON EVERYTHINGIS SWEPT AWAY. THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS ACCORDING TO NIETZSCHE HAS NOWBEEN REACHED. OH MY BRETHREN IS NOT EVERYTHING AT PRESENT IN FLUXHAVE NOT ALL RAILINGS AND FOOTBRIDGES FALLEN INTO THE WATER WHO WOULDSTILL HOLD ON TO GOOD AND EVILPAR. .THIS IS COMPLEMENTARY TO THE FIRST THREE VERSES OF PAR. .PAR. .SO FAR THIS IS PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT PARAGRAPH. IT IS A PROTESTAGAINST READING A MORAL ORDER OF THINGS IN LIFE. LIFE IS SOMETHINGESSENTIALLY IMMORAL NIETZSCHE TELLS US IN THE INTRODUCTION TO THEBIRTH OF TRAGEDY. EVEN TO CALL LIFE ACTIVITY OR TO DEFINE ITFURTHER AS THE CONTINUOUS ADJUSTMENT OF INTERNAL RELATIONS TO EXTERNALRELATIONS AS SPENCER HAS IT NIETZSCHE CHARACTERISES AS A DEMOCRATICIDIOSYNCRACY. HE SAYS TO DEFINE IT IN THIS WAY IS TO MISTAKE THETRUE NATURE AND FUNCTION OF LIFE WHICH IS WILL TO POWER.... LIFE ISESSENTIALLY APPROPRIATION INJURY CONQUEST OF THE STRANGE AND WEAKSUPPRESSION SEVERITY OBTRUSION OF ITS OWN FORMS INCORPORATION ANDAT LEAST PUTTING IT MILDEST EXPLOITATION. ADAPTATION IS MERELY ASECONDARY ACTIVITY A MERE REACTIVITY SEE NOTE ON CHAPTER LVII..PARS. .THESE DEAL WITH NIETZSCHES PRINCIPLE OF THE DESIRABILITY OF REARING ASELECT RACE. THE BIOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL GROUNDS FOR HIS INSISTENCEUPON THIS PRINCIPLE ARE OF COURSE MANIFOLD. GOBINEAU IN HIS GREATWORK LINEGALITE DES RACES HUMAINES LAYS STRONG EMPHASIS UPON THEEVILS WHICH ARISE FROM PROMISCUOUS AND INTERSOCIAL MARRIAGES. HE ALONEWOULD SUFFICE TO CARRY NIETZSCHES POINT AGAINST ALL THOSE WHO AREOPPOSED TO THE OTHER CONDITIONS TO THE CONDITIONS WHICH WOULD HAVESAVED ROME WHICH HAVE MAINTAINED THE STRENGTH OF THE JEWISH RACE ANDWHICH ARE STRICTLY MAINTAINED BY EVERY BREEDER OF ANIMALS THROUGHOUT THEWORLD. DARWIN IN HIS REMARKS RELATIVE TO THE DEGENERATION OF CULTIVATEDTYPES OF ANIMALS THROUGH THE ACTION OF PROMISCUOUS BREEDING BRINGSGOBINEAU SUPPORT FROM THE REALM OF BIOLOGY.THE LAST TWO VERSES OF PAR. WERE DISCUSSED IN THE NOTES ON CHAPTERSXXXVI. AND LIII.PAR. .THIS LIKE THE FIRST PART OF THE SOOTHSAYER IS OBVIOUSLY A REFERENCETO THE SCHOPENHAUERIAN PESSIMISM.PARS. .THESE ARE SUPPLEMENTARY TO THE DISCOURSE BACKWORLDSMEN.PAR. .WE MUST BE CAREFUL TO SEPARATE THIS PARAGRAPH IN SENSE FROM THEPREVIOUS FOUR PARAGRAPHS. NIETZSCHE IS STILL DEALING WITH PESSIMISMHERE BUT IT IS THE PESSIMISM OF THE HEROTHE MAN MOST SUSCEPTIBLE OFALL TO DESPERATE VIEWS OF LIFE OWING TO THE OBSTACLES THAT ARE ARRAYEDAGAINST HIM IN A WORLD WHERE MEN OF HIS KIND ARE VERY RARE AND ARECONTINUALLY BEING SACRIFICED. IT WAS TO SAVE THIS MAN THAT NIETZSCHEWROTE. HEROISM FOILED THWARTED AND WRECKED HOPING AND FIGHTING UNTILTHE LAST IS AT LENGTH OVERTAKEN BY DESPAIR AND RENOUNCES ALL STRUGGLEFOR SLEEP. THIS IS NOT THE NATURAL OR CONSTITUTIONAL PESSIMISM WHICHPROCEEDS FROM AN UNHEALTHY BODYTHE DYSPEPTICS LACK OF APPETITE ITIS RATHER THE DESPERATION OF THE NETTED LION THAT ULTIMATELY STOPS ALLMOVEMENT BECAUSE THE MORE IT MOVES THE MORE INVOLVED IT BECOMES.PAR. .ALL THAT INCREASES POWER IS GOOD ALL THAT SPRINGS FROM WEAKNESS ISBAD. THE WEAK AND ILLCONSTITUTED SHALL PERISH FIRST PRINCIPLE OF OURCHARITY. AND ONE SHALL ALSO HELP THEM THERETO. NIETZSCHE PARTLY DIVINEDTHE KIND OF RECEPTION MORAL VALUES OF THIS STAMP WOULD MEET WITH ATTHE HANDS OF THE EFFEMINATE MANHOOD OF EUROPE. HERE WE SEE THAT HE HADANTICIPATED THE MOST LIKELY FORM THEIR CRITICISM WOULD TAKE SEE ALSOTHE LAST TWO VERSES OF PAR. .PAR. .THE FIRST TEN VERSES HERE ARE REMINISCENT OF WAR AND WARRIORS ANDOF THE FLIES IN THE MARKETPLACE. VERSES AND HOWEVER AREPARTICULARLY IMPORTANT. THERE IS A STRONG ARGUMENT IN FAVOUR OF THESHARP DIFFERENTIATION OF CASTES AND OF RACES AND EVEN OF SEXES SEENOTE ON CHAPTER XVIII. RUNNING ALL THROUGH NIETZSCHES WRITINGS.BUT SHARP DIFFERENTIATION ALSO IMPLIES ANTAGONISM IN SOME FORM OROTHERHENCE NIETZSCHES FEARS FOR MODERN MEN. WHAT MODERN MEN DESIREABOVE ALL IS PEACE AND THE CESSATION OF PAIN. BUT NEITHER GREAT RACESNOR GREAT CASTES HAVE EVER BEEN BUILT UP IN THIS WAY. WHO STILL WANTETHTO RULE ZARATHUSTRA ASKS IN THE PROLOGUE. WHO STILL WANTETH TOOBEY BOTH ARE TOO BURDENSOME. THIS IS RAPIDLY BECOMING EVERYBODYSATTITUDE TODAY. THE TAME MORAL READING OF THE FACE OF NATURE TOGETHERWITH SUCH DEMOCRATIC INTERPRETATIONS OF LIFE AS THOSE SUGGESTED BYHERBERT SPENCER ARE SIGNS OF A PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITION WHICH IS THEREVERSE OF THAT BOUNDING AND IRRESPONSIBLE HEALTHINESS IN WHICH HARDERAND MORE TRAGIC VALUES RULE.PAR. .THIS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH CHILD AND MARRIAGE. IN THEFIFTH VERSE WE SHALL RECOGNISE OUR OLD FRIEND MARRIAGE ON THE TENYEARSSYSTEM WHICH GEORGE MEREDITH SUGGESTED SOME YEARS AGO. THIS HOWEVERMUST NOT BE TAKEN TOO LITERALLY. I DO NOT THINK NIETZSCHES PROFOUNDESTVIEWS ON MARRIAGE WERE EVER INTENDED TO BE GIVEN OVER TO THE PUBLIC ATALL AT LEAST NOT FOR THE PRESENT. THEY APPEAR IN THE BIOGRAPHY BY HISSISTER AND ALTHOUGH THEIR WISDOM IS UNQUESTIONABLE THE NATURE OF THEREFORMS HE SUGGESTS RENDER IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO BECOME POPULAR JUSTNOW.PARS. .SEE NOTE ON THE PROLOGUE.PAR. .NIETZSCHE WAS NOT AN ICONOCLAST FROM PREDILECTION. NO BITTERNESS OREMPTY HATE DICTATED HIS VITUPERATIONS AGAINST EXISTING VALUES ANDAGAINST THE DOGMAS OF HIS PARENTS AND FOREFATHERS. HE KNEW TOO WELL WHATTHESE THINGS MEANT TO THE MILLIONS WHO PROFESS THEM TO APPROACH THETASK OF UPROOTING THEM WITH LEVITY OR EVEN WITH HASTE. HE SAW WHATMODERN ANARCHISTS AND REVOLUTIONISTS DO NOT SEENAMELY THAT MAN IS INDANGER OF ACTUAL DESTRUCTION WHEN HIS CUSTOMS AND VALUES ARE BROKEN.I NEED HARDLY POINT OUT THEREFORE HOW DEEPLY HE WAS CONSCIOUS OFTHE RESPONSIBILITY HE THREW UPON OUR SHOULDERS WHEN HE INVITED US TORECONSIDER OUR POSITION. THE LINES IN THIS PARAGRAPH ARE EVIDENCE ENOUGHOF HIS EARNESTNESS.CHAPTER LVII. THE CONVALESCENT.WE MEET WITH SEVERAL PUZZLES HERE. ZARATHUSTRA CALLS HIMSELF THEADVOCATE OF THE CIRCLE THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE OF ALL THINGS AND HECALLS THIS DOCTRINE HIS ABYSMAL THOUGHT. IN THE LAST VERSE OF THEFIRST PARAGRAPH HOWEVER AFTER HAILING HIS DEEPEST THOUGHT HE CRIESDISGUST DISGUST DISGUST WE KNOW NIETZSCHES IDEAL MAN WAS THATWORLDAPPROVING EXUBERANT AND VIVACIOUS CREATURE WHO HAS NOT ONLYLEARNT TO COMPROMISE AND ARRANGE WITH THAT WHICH WAS AND IS BUT WISHESTO HAVE IT AGAIN AS IT WAS AND IS FOR ALL ETERNITY INSATIABLY CALLINGOUT DA CAPO NOT ONLY TO HIMSELF BUT TO THE WHOLE PIECE AND PLAY SEENOTE ON CHAPTER XLII.. BUT IF ONE ASK ONESELF WHAT THE CONDITIONS TOSUCH AN ATTITUDE ARE ONE WILL REALISE IMMEDIATELY HOW UTTERLY DIFFERENTNIETZSCHE WAS FROM HIS IDEAL. THE MAN WHO INSATIABLY CRIES DA CAPO TOHIMSELF AND TO THE WHOLE OF HIS MISEENSCENE MUST BE IN A POSITION TODESIRE EVERY INCIDENT IN HIS LIFE TO BE REPEATED NOT ONCE BUTAGAIN AND AGAIN ETERNALLY. NOW NIETZSCHES LIFE HAD BEEN TOO FULL OFDISAPPOINTMENTS ILLNESS UNSUCCESSFUL STRUGGLES AND SNUBS TO ALLOW OFHIS THINKING OF THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE WITHOUT LOATHINGHENCE PROBABLYTHE WORDS OF THE LAST VERSE.IN VERSES AND WE HAVE NIETZSCHE DECLARING HIMSELF AN EVOLUTIONISTIN THE BROADEST SENSETHAT IS TO SAY THAT HE BELIEVES IN THEDEVELOPMENT HYPOTHESIS AS THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCESS BY WHICHSPECIES HAVE ORIGINATED. NOW TO UNDERSTAND HIS POSITION CORRECTLYWE MUST SHOW HIS RELATIONSHIP TO THE TWO GREATEST OF MODERNEVOLUTIONISTSDARWIN AND SPENCER. AS A PHILOSOPHER HOWEVER NIETZSCHEDOES NOT STAND OR FALL BY HIS OBJECTIONS TO THE DARWINIAN OR SPENCERIANCOSMOGONY. HE NEVER LAID CLAIM TO A VERY PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE OF BIOLOGYAND HIS CRITICISM IS FAR MORE VALUABLE AS THE ATTITUDE OF A FRESH MINDTHAN AS THAT OF A SPECIALIST TOWARDS THE QUESTION. MOREOVER IN HISOBJECTIONS MANY DIFFICULTIES ARE RAISED WHICH ARE NOT SETTLED BY ANAPPEAL TO EITHER OF THE MEN ABOVE MENTIONED. WE HAVE GIVEN NIETZSCHESDEFINITION OF LIFE IN THE NOTE ON CHAPTER LVI. PAR. . STILL THEREREMAINS A HOPE THAT DARWIN AND NIETZSCHE MAY SOME DAY BECOME RECONCILEDBY A NEW DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCESSES BY WHICH VARIETIES OCCUR. THEAPPEARANCE OF VARIETIES AMONG ANIMALS AND OF SPORTING PLANTS INTHE VEGETABLE KINGDOM IS STILL SHROUDED IN MYSTERY AND THE QUESTIONWHETHER THIS IS NOT PRECISELY THE GROUND ON WHICH DARWIN AND NIETZSCHEWILL MEET IS AN INTERESTING ONE. THE FORMER SAYS IN HIS ORIGIN OFSPECIES CONCERNING THE CAUSES OF VARIABILITY ...THERE ARE TWOFACTORS NAMELY THE NATURE OF THE ORGANISM AND THE NATURE OF THECONDITIONS. THE FORMER SEEMS TO BE MUCH THE MORE IMPORTANT THE ITALICSARE MINE. FOR NEARLY SIMILAR VARIATIONS SOMETIMES ARISE UNDER ASFAR AS WE CAN JUDGE DISSIMILAR CONDITIONS AND ON THE OTHER HANDDISSIMILAR VARIATIONS ARISE UNDER CONDITIONS WHICH APPEAR TO BENEARLY UNIFORM. NIETZSCHE RECOGNISING THIS SAME TRUTH WOULD ASCRIBEPRACTICALLY ALL THE IMPORTANCE TO THE HIGHEST FUNCTIONARIES IN THEORGANISM IN WHICH THE LIFEWILL APPEARS AS AN ACTIVE AND FORMATIVEPRINCIPLE AND EXCEPT IN CERTAIN CASES WHERE PASSIVE ORGANISMS ALONEARE CONCERNED WOULD NOT GIVE SUCH A PROMINENT PLACE TO THE INFLUENCEOF ENVIRONMENT. ADAPTATION ACCORDING TO HIM IS MERELY A SECONDARYACTIVITY A MERE REACTIVITY AND HE IS THEREFORE QUITE OPPOSED TOSPENCERS DEFINITION LIFE IS THE CONTINUOUS ADJUSTMENT OF INTERNALRELATIONS TO EXTERNAL RELATIONS. AGAIN IN THE MOTIVE FORCE BEHINDANIMAL AND PLANT LIFE NIETZSCHE DISAGREES WITH DARWIN. HETRANSFORMS THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCETHE PASSIVE AND INVOLUNTARYCONDITIONINTO THE STRUGGLE FOR POWER WHICH IS ACTIVE AND CREATIVEAND MUCH MORE IN HARMONY WITH DARWINS OWN VIEW GIVEN ABOVE CONCERNINGTHE IMPORTANCE OF THE ORGANISM ITSELF. THE CHANGE IS ONE OF SUCHFARREACHING IMPORTANCE THAT WE CANNOT DISPOSE OF IT IN A BREATH AS AMERE PLAY UPON WORDS. MUCH IS RECKONED HIGHER THAN LIFE ITSELF BY THELIVING ONE. NIETZSCHE SAYS THAT TO SPEAK OF THE ACTIVITY OF LIFE AS ASTRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE IS TO STATE THE CASE INADEQUATELY. HE WARNS USNOT TO CONFOUND MALTHUS WITH NATURE. THERE IS SOMETHING MORE THANTHIS STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE ORGANIC BEINGS ON THIS EARTH WANT WHICH ISSUPPOSED TO BRING THIS STRUGGLE ABOUT IS NOT SO COMMON AS IS SUPPOSEDSOME OTHER FORCE MUST BE OPERATIVE. THE WILL TO POWER IS THIS FORCETHE INSTINCT OF SELFPRESERVATION IS ONLY ONE OF THE INDIRECT AND MOSTFREQUENT RESULTS THEREOF. A CERTAIN LACK OF ACUMEN IN PSYCHOLOGICALQUESTIONS AND THE CONDITION OF AFFAIRS IN ENGLAND AT THE TIME DARWINWROTE MAY BOTH ACCORDING TO NIETZSCHE HAVE INDUCED THE RENOWNEDNATURALIST TO DESCRIBE THE FORCES OF NATURE AS HE DID IN HIS ORIGIN OFSPECIES.IN VERSES AND OF THE SECOND PORTION OF THIS DISCOURSE WE MEETWITH A DOCTRINE WHICH AT FIRST SIGHT SEEMS TO BE MERELY LE MANOIRA LENVERS INDEED ONE ENGLISH CRITIC HAS ACTUALLY SAID OF NIETZSCHETHAT THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA IS NO MORE THAN A COMPENDIUM OF MODERNVIEWS AND MAXIMS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN. EXAMINING THESE HETERODOXPRONOUNCEMENTS A LITTLE MORE CLOSELY HOWEVER WE MAY POSSIBLY PERCEIVETHEIR TRUTH. REGARDING GOOD AND EVIL AS PURELY RELATIVE VALUES ITSTANDS TO REASON THAT WHAT MAY BE BAD OR EVIL IN A GIVEN MAN RELATIVETO A CERTAIN ENVIRONMENT MAY ACTUALLY BE GOOD IF NOT HIGHLY VIRTUOUSIN HIM RELATIVE TO A CERTAIN OTHER ENVIRONMENT. IF THIS HYPOTHETICAL MANREPRESENT THE ASCENDING LINE OF LIFETHAT IS TO SAY IF HE PROMISE ALLTHAT WHICH IS HIGHEST IN A GRAECOROMAN SENSE THEN IT IS LIKELY THATHE WILL BE CONDEMNED AS WICKED IF INTRODUCED INTO THE SOCIETY OF MENREPRESENTING THE OPPOSITE AND DESCENDING LINE OF LIFE.BY DEPRIVING A MAN OF HIS WICKEDNESSMORE PARTICULARLY NOWADAYSTHEREFORE ONE MAY UNWITTINGLY BE DOING VIOLENCE TO THE GREATEST IN HIM.IT MAY BE AN OUTRAGE AGAINST HIS WHOLENESS JUST AS THE LOPPINGOFF OF ALEG WOULD BE. FORTUNATELY THE NATURAL SOCALLED WICKEDNESS OF HIGHERMEN HAS IN A CERTAIN MEASURE BEEN ABLE TO RESIST THIS LOPPING PROCESSWHICH SUCCESSIVE SLAVEMORALITIES HAVE PRACTISED BUT SIGNS ARE NOTWANTING WHICH SHOW THAT THE NOBLEST WICKEDNESS IS FAST VANISHING FROMSOCIETYTHE WICKEDNESS OF COURAGE AND DETERMINATIONAND THAT NIETZSCHEHAD GOOD REASONS FOR CRYING AH THAT MANS BADDEST IS SO VERY SMALLAH THAT HIS BEST IS SO VERY SMALL. WHAT IS GOOD TO BE BRAVE IS GOODIT IS THE GOOD WAR WHICH HALLOWETH EVERY CAUSE SEE ALSO PAR. HIGHER MAN.CHAPTER LX. THE SEVEN SEALS.THIS IS A FINAL PAEAN WHICH ZARATHUSTRA SINGS TO ETERNITY AND THEMARRIAGERING OF RINGS THE RING OF THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE. ...PART IV.IN MY OPINION THIS PART IS NIETZSCHES OPEN AVOWAL THAT ALL HISPHILOSOPHY TOGETHER WITH ALL HIS HOPES ENTHUSIASTIC OUTBURSTSBLASPHEMIES PROLIXITIES AND OBSCURITIES WERE MERELY SO MANY GIFTSLAID AT THE FEET OF HIGHER MEN. HE HAD NO DESIRE TO SAVE THE WORLD. WHATHE WISHED TO DETERMINE WAS WHO IS TO BE MASTER OF THE WORLD THIS ISA VERY DIFFERENT THING. HE CAME TO SAVE HIGHER MENTO GIVE THEM THATFREEDOM BY WHICH ALONE THEY CAN DEVELOP AND REACH THEIR ZENITH SEENOTE ON CHAPTER LIV. END. IT HAS BEEN ARGUED AND WITH CONSIDERABLEFORCE THAT NO SUCH PHILOSOPHY IS REQUIRED BY HIGHER MEN THAT AS AMATTER OF FACT HIGHER MEN BY VIRTUE OF THEIR CONSTITUTIONS ALWAYS DOSTAND BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL AND NEVER ALLOW ANYTHING TO STAND IN THEWAY OF THEIR COMPLETE GROWTH. NIETZSCHE HOWEVER WAS EVIDENTLY NOT SOCONFIDENT ABOUT THIS. HE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE ARGUED THAT WE ONLY SEE THESUCCESSFUL CASES. BEING A GREAT MAN HIMSELF HE WAS WELL AWARE OF THEDANGERS THREATENING GREATNESS IN OUR AGE. IN BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL HEWRITES THERE ARE FEW PAINS SO GRIEVOUS AS TO HAVE SEEN DIVINEDOR EXPERIENCED HOW AN EXCEPTIONAL MAN HAS MISSED HIS WAY ANDDETERIORATED... HE KNEW FROM HIS PAINFULLEST RECOLLECTIONS ON WHATWRETCHED OBSTACLES PROMISING DEVELOPMENTS OF THE HIGHEST RANK HAVEHITHERTO USUALLY GONE TO PIECES BROKEN DOWN SUNK AND BECOMECONTEMPTIBLE. NOW IN PART IV. WE SHALL FIND THAT HIS STRONGESTTEMPTATION TO DESCEND TO THE FEELING OF PITY FOR HIS CONTEMPORARIESIS THE CRY FOR HELP WHICH HE HEARS FROM THE LIPS OF THE HIGHER MENEXPOSED TO THE DREADFUL DANGER OF THEIR MODERN ENVIRONMENT.CHAPTER LXI. THE HONEY SACRIFICE.IN THE FOURTEENTH VERSE OF THIS DISCOURSE NIETZSCHE DEFINES THE SOLEMNDUTY HE IMPOSED UPON HIMSELF BECOME WHAT THOU ART. SURELY THECRITICISM WHICH HAS BEEN DIRECTED AGAINST THIS MAXIM MUST ALL FALL TOTHE GROUND WHEN IT IS REMEMBERED ONCE AND FOR ALL THAT NIETZSCHESTEACHING WAS NEVER INTENDED TO BE OTHER THAN AN ESOTERIC ONE. I AM ALAW ONLY FOR MINE OWN HE SAYS EMPHATICALLY I AM NOT A LAW FORALL. IT IS OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE TO HUMANITY THAT ITS HIGHESTINDIVIDUALS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO ATTAIN TO THEIR FULL DEVELOPMENT FORONLY BY MEANS OF ITS HEROES CAN THE HUMAN RACE BE LED FORWARD STEP BYSTEP TO HIGHER AND YET HIGHER LEVELS. BECOME WHAT THOU ART APPLIEDTO ALL OF COURSE BECOMES A VICIOUS MAXIM IT IS TO BE HOPED HOWEVERTHAT WE MAY LEARN IN TIME THAT THE SAME ACTION PERFORMED BY A GIVENNUMBER OF MEN LOSES ITS IDENTITY PRECISELY THAT SAME NUMBER OFTIMES.QUOD LICET JOVI NON LICET BOVI.AT THE LAST EIGHT VERSES MANY READERS MAY BE TEMPTED TO LAUGH. INENGLAND WE ALMOST ALWAYS LAUGH WHEN A MAN TAKES HIMSELF SERIOUSLY ATANYTHING SAVE SPORT. AND THERE IS OF COURSE NO REASON WHY THE READERSHOULD NOT BE HILARIOUS.A CERTAIN GREATNESS IS REQUISITE BOTH INORDER TO BE SUBLIME AND TO HAVE REVERENCE FOR THE SUBLIME. NIETZSCHEEARNESTLY BELIEVED THAT THE ZARATHUSTRAKINGDOMHIS DYNASTY OF ATHOUSAND YEARSWOULD ONE DAY COME IF HE HAD NOT BELIEVED IT SOEARNESTLY IF EVERY ARTIST IN FACT HAD NOT BELIEVED SO EARNESTLY INHIS HAZAR WHETHER OF TEN FIFTEEN A HUNDRED OR A THOUSAND YEARS WESHOULD HAVE LOST ALL OUR HIGHER MEN THEY WOULD HAVE BECOME PESSIMISTSSUICIDES OR MERCHANTS. IF THE MINOR POET AND PHILOSOPHER HAS MADE USSHY OF THE PROPHETIC SERIOUSNESS WHICH CHARACTERIZED AN ISAIAH OR AJEREMIAH IT IS SURELY OUR LOSS AND THE MINOR POETS GAIN.CHAPTER LXII. THE CRY OF DISTRESS.WE NOW MEET WITH ZARATHUSTRA IN EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES. HE ISCONFRONTED WITH SCHOPENHAUER AND TEMPTED BY THE OLD SOOTHSAYER TO COMMITTHE SIN OF PITY. I HAVE COME THAT I MAY SEDUCE THEE TO THY LAST SIN SAYS THE SOOTHSAYER TO ZARATHUSTRA. IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT INSCHOPENHAUERS ETHICS PITY IS ELEVATED TO THE HIGHEST PLACE AMONG THEVIRTUES AND VERY CONSISTENTLY TOO SEEING THAT THE WELTANSCHAUUNG ISA PESSIMISTIC ONE. SCHOPENHAUER APPEALS TO NIETZSCHES DEEPEST ANDSTRONGEST SENTIMENTHIS SYMPATHY FOR HIGHER MEN. WHY DOST THOU CONCEALTHYSELF HE CRIES. IT IS THE HIGHER MAN THAT CALLETH FOR THEE ZARATHUSTRA IS ALMOST OVERCOME BY THE SOOTHSAYERS PLEADING AS HEHAD BEEN ONCE ALREADY IN THE PAST BUT HE RESISTS HIM STEP BY STEP. ATLENGTH HE CAN WITHSTAND HIM NO LONGER AND ON THE PLEA THAT THE HIGHERMAN IS ON HIS GROUND AND THEREFORE UNDER HIS PROTECTION ZARATHUSTRADEPARTS IN SEARCH OF HIM LEAVING SCHOPENHAUERA HIGHER MAN INNIETZSCHES OPINIONIN THE CAVE AS A GUEST.CHAPTER LXIII. TALK WITH THE KINGS.ON HIS WAY ZARATHUSTRA MEETS TWO MORE HIGHER MEN OF HIS TIME TWOKINGS CROSS HIS PATH. THEY ARE ABOVE THE AVERAGE MODERN TYPE FOR THEIRINSTINCTS TELL THEM WHAT REAL RULING IS AND THEY DESPISE THE MOCKERYWHICH THEY HAVE BEEN TAUGHT TO CALL REIGNING. WE ARE NOT THE FIRSTMEN THEY SAY AND HAVE NEVERTHELESS TO STAND FOR THEM OF THISIMPOSTURE HAVE WE AT LAST BECOME WEARY AND DISGUSTED. IT IS THE KINGSWHO TELL ZARATHUSTRA THERE IS NO SORER MISFORTUNE IN ALL HUMAN DESTINYTHAN WHEN THE MIGHTY OF THE EARTH ARE NOT ALSO THE FIRST MEN. THEREEVERYTHING BECOMETH FALSE AND DISTORTED AND MONSTROUS. THE KINGS AREALSO ASKED BY ZARATHUSTRA TO ACCEPT THE SHELTER OF HIS CAVE WHEREUPONHE PROCEEDS ON HIS WAY.CHAPTER LXIV. THE LEECH.AMONG THE HIGHER MEN WHOM ZARATHUSTRA WISHES TO SAVE IS ALSO THESCIENTIFIC SPECIALISTTHE MAN WHO HONESTLY AND SCRUPULOUSLY PURSUES HISINVESTIGATIONS AS DARWIN DID IN ONE DEPARTMENT OF KNOWLEDGE. I LOVEHIM WHO LIVETH IN ORDER TO KNOW AND SEEKETH TO KNOW IN ORDER THAT THESUPERMAN MAY HEREAFTER LIVE. THUS SEEKETH HE HIS OWN DOWNGOING. THE SPIRITUALLY CONSCIENTIOUS ONE HE IS CALLED IN THIS DISCOURSE.ZARATHUSTRA STEPS ON HIM UNAWARES AND THE SLAVE OF SCIENCE BLEEDINGFROM THE VIOLENCE HE HAS DONE TO HIMSELF BY HIS SELFIMPOSED TASKSPEAKS PROUDLY OF HIS LITTLE SPHERE OF KNOWLEDGEHIS LITTLE HANDSBREADTH OF GROUND ON ZARATHUSTRAS TERRITORY PHILOSOPHY. WHERE MINEHONESTY CEASETH SAYS THE TRUE SCIENTIFIC SPECIALIST THERE AM I BLINDAND WANT ALSO TO BE BLIND. WHERE I WANT TO KNOW HOWEVER THERE WANTI ALSO TO BE HONESTNAMELY SEVERE RIGOROUS RESTRICTED CRUEL ANDINEXORABLE. ZARATHUSTRA GREATLY RESPECTING THIS MAN INVITES HIM TOO TOTHE CAVE AND THEN VANISHES IN ANSWER TO ANOTHER CRY FOR HELP.CHAPTER LXV. THE MAGICIAN.THE MAGICIAN IS OF COURSE AN ARTIST AND NIETZSCHES INTIMATE KNOWLEDGEOF PERHAPS THE GREATEST ARTIST OF HIS AGE RENDERED THE SELECTION OFWAGNER AS THE TYPE IN THIS DISCOURSE ALMOST INEVITABLE. MOST READERSWILL BE ACQUAINTED WITH THE FACTS RELATING TO NIETZSCHES AND WAGNERSFRIENDSHIP AND ULTIMATE SEPARATION. AS A BOY AND A YOUTH NIETZSCHE HADSHOWN SUCH A REMARKABLE GIFT FOR MUSIC THAT IT HAD BEEN A QUESTION ATONE TIME WHETHER HE SHOULD NOT PERHAPS GIVE UP EVERYTHING ELSE IN ORDERTO DEVELOP THIS GIFT BUT HE BECAME A SCHOLAR NOTWITHSTANDING ALTHOUGHHE NEVER ENTIRELY GAVE UP COMPOSING AND PLAYING THE PIANO. WHILESTILL IN HIS TEENS HE BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH WAGNERS MUSIC ANDGREW PASSIONATELY FOND OF IT. LONG BEFORE HE MET WAGNER HE MUST HAVEIDEALISED HIM IN HIS MIND TO AN EXTENT WHICH ONLY A PROFOUNDLY ARTISTICNATURE COULD HAVE BEEN CAPABLE OF. NIETZSCHE ALWAYS HAD HIGH IDEALS FORHUMANITY. IF ONE WERE ASKED WHETHER THROUGHOUT HIS MANY CHANGES THEREWAS YET ONE AIM ONE DIRECTION AND ONE HOPE TO WHICH HE HELD FASTONE WOULD BE FORCED TO REPLY IN THE AFFIRMATIVE AND DECLARE THAT AIMDIRECTION AND HOPE TO HAVE BEEN THE ELEVATION OF THE TYPE MAN. NOW WHEN NIETZSCHE MET WAGNER HE WAS ACTUALLY CASTING ABOUT FOR ANINCARNATION OF HIS DREAMS FOR THE GERMAN PEOPLE AND WE HAVE ONLY TOREMEMBER HIS YOUTH HE WAS TWENTYONE WHEN HE WAS INTRODUCED TO WAGNERHIS LOVE OF WAGNERS MUSIC AND THE UNDOUBTED POWER OF THE GREATMUSICIANS PERSONALITY IN ORDER TO REALISE HOW VERY UNCRITICAL HISATTITUDE MUST HAVE BEEN IN THE FIRST FLOOD OF HIS ENTHUSIASM. AGAINWHEN THE FRIENDSHIP RIPENED WE CANNOT WELL IMAGINE NIETZSCHE THEYOUNGER MAN BEING ANYTHING LESS THAN INTOXICATED BY HIS SENIORSATTENTION AND LOVE AND WE ARE THEREFORE NOT SURPRISED TO FIND HIMPRESSING WAGNER FORWARD AS THE GREAT REFORMER AND SAVIOUR OF MANKIND.WAGNER IN BAYREUTH ENGLISH EDITION GIVES US THE BEST PROOFOF NIETZSCHES INFATUATION AND ALTHOUGH SIGNS ARE NOT WANTING IN THISESSAY WHICH SHOW HOW CLEARLY AND EVEN CRUELLY HE WAS SUBCONSCIOUSLYTAKING STOCK OF HIS FRIENDEVEN THEN THE WORK IS A RECORD OF WHATGREAT LOVE AND ADMIRATION CAN DO IN THE WAY OF ENDOWING THE OBJECTOF ONES AFFECTION WITH ALL THE QUALITIES AND IDEALS THAT A FERTILEIMAGINATION CAN CONCEIVE.WHEN THE BLOW CAME IT WAS THEREFORE ALL THE MORE SEVERE. NIETZSCHEAT LENGTH REALISED THAT THE FRIEND OF HIS FANCY AND THE REAL RICHARDWAGNERTHE COMPOSER OF PARSIFALWERE NOT ONE THE FACT DAWNEDUPON HIM SLOWLY DISAPPOINTMENT UPON DISAPPOINTMENT REVELATION AFTERREVELATION ULTIMATELY BROUGHT IT HOME TO HIM AND THOUGH HIS BESTINSTINCTS WERE NATURALLY OPPOSED TO IT AT FIRST THE REVULSION OFFEELING AT LAST BECAME TOO STRONG TO BE IGNORED AND NIETZSCHE WASPLUNGED INTO THE BLACKEST DESPAIR. YEARS AFTER HIS BREAK WITH WAGNERHE WROTE THE CASE OF WAGNER AND NIETZSCHE CONTRA WAGNER AND THESEWORKS ARE WITH US TO PROVE THE SINCERITY AND DEPTH OF HIS VIEWS ON THEMAN WHO WAS THE GREATEST EVENT OF HIS LIFE.THE POEM IN THIS DISCOURSE IS OF COURSE REMINISCENT OF WAGNERS OWNPOETICAL MANNER AND IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT THE WHOLE WAS WRITTENSUBSEQUENT TO NIETZSCHES FINAL BREAK WITH HIS FRIEND. THE DIALOGUEBETWEEN ZARATHUSTRA AND THE MAGICIAN REVEALS PRETTY FULLY WHAT ITWAS THAT NIETZSCHE GREW TO LOATHE SO INTENSELY IN WAGNERVIZ. HISPRONOUNCED HISTRIONIC TENDENCIES HIS DISSEMBLING POWERS HIS INORDINATEVANITY HIS EQUIVOCALNESS HIS FALSENESS. IT HONOURETH THEE SAYSZARATHUSTRA THAT THOU SOUGHTEST FOR GREATNESS BUT IT BETRAYETH THEEALSO. THOU ART NOT GREAT. THE MAGICIAN IS NEVERTHELESS SENT AS A GUESTTO ZARATHUSTRAS CAVE FOR IN HIS HEART ZARATHUSTRA BELIEVED UNTIL THEEND THAT THE MAGICIAN WAS A HIGHER MAN BROKEN BY MODERN VALUES.CHAPTER LXVI. OUT OF SERVICE.ZARATHUSTRA NOW MEETS THE LAST POPE AND IN A POETICAL FORM WE GETNIETZSCHES DESCRIPTION OF THE COURSE JUDAISM AND CHRISTIANITY PURSUEDBEFORE THEY REACHED THEIR FINAL BREAKUP IN ATHEISM AGNOSTICISM ANDTHE LIKE. THE GOD OF A STRONG WARLIKE RACETHE GOD OF ISRAELIS AJEALOUS REVENGEFUL GOD. HE IS A POWER THAT CAN BE PICTURED AND ENDUREDONLY BY A HARDY AND COURAGEOUS RACE A RACE RICH ENOUGH TO SACRIFICE ANDTO LOSE IN SACRIFICE. THE IMAGE OF THIS GOD DEGENERATES WITH THE PEOPLETHAT APPROPRIATE IT AND GRADUALLY HE BECOMES A GOD OF LOVESOFT ANDMELLOW A LOWER MIDDLECLASS DEITY WHO IS PITIFUL. HE CAN NO LONGERBE A GOD WHO REQUIRES SACRIFICE FOR WE OURSELVES ARE NO LONGER RICHENOUGH FOR THAT. THE TABLES ARE THEREFORE TURNED UPON HIM HE MUSTSACRIFICE TO US. HIS PITY BECOMES SO GREAT THAT HE ACTUALLY DOESSACRIFICE SOMETHING TO USHIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON. SUCH A PROCESSCARRIED TO ITS LOGICAL CONCLUSIONS MUST ULTIMATELY END IN HIS OWNDESTRUCTION AND THUS WE FIND THE POPE DECLARING THAT GOD WAS ONE DAYSUFFOCATED BY HIS ALLTOOGREAT PITY. WHAT FOLLOWS IS CLEAR ENOUGH.ZARATHUSTRA RECOGNISES ANOTHER HIGHER MAN IN THE EXPOPE AND SENDS HIMTOO AS A GUEST TO THE CAVE.CHAPTER LXVII. THE UGLIEST MAN.THIS DISCOURSE CONTAINS PERHAPS THE BOLDEST OF NIETZSCHES SUGGESTIONSCONCERNING ATHEISM AS WELL AS SOME EXTREMELY PENETRATING REMARKS UPONTHE SENTIMENT OF PITY. ZARATHUSTRA COMES ACROSS THE REPULSIVE CREATURESITTING ON THE WAYSIDE AND WHAT DOES HE DO HE MANIFESTS THE ONLYCORRECT FEELINGS THAT CAN BE MANIFESTED IN THE PRESENCE OF ANY GREATMISERYTHAT IS TO SAY SHAME REVERENCE EMBARRASSMENT. NIETZSCHEDETESTED THE OBTRUSIVE AND GUSHING PITY THAT GOES UP TO MISERY WITHOUTA BLUSH EITHER ON ITS CHEEK OR IN ITS HEARTTHE PITY WHICH IS ONLYANOTHER FORM OF SELFGLORIFICATION. THANK GOD THAT I AM NOT LIKETHEEONLY THIS SELFGLORIFYING SENTIMENT CAN LEND A WELLCONSTITUTEDMAN THE IMPUDENCE TO SHOW HIS PITY FOR THE CRIPPLE AND THEILLCONSTITUTED. IN THE PRESENCE OF THE UGLIEST MAN NIETZSCHEBLUSHESHE BLUSHES FOR HIS RACE HIS OWN PARTICULAR KIND OFALTRUISMTHE ALTRUISM THAT MIGHT HAVE PREVENTED THE EXISTENCE OF THISMANSTRIKES HIM WITH ALL ITS FORCE. HE WILL HAVE THE WORLD OTHERWISE.HE WILL HAVE A WORLD WHERE ONE NEED NOT BLUSH FOR ONES FELLOWSHENCEHIS APPEAL TO US TO LOVE ONLY OUR CHILDRENS LAND THE LAND UNDISCOVEREDIN THE REMOTEST SEA.ZARATHUSTRA CALLS THE UGLIEST MAN THE MURDERER OF GOD CERTAINLY THISIS ONE ASPECT OF A CERTAIN KIND OF ATHEISMTHE ATHEISM OF THE MAN WHOREVERES BEAUTY TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT HIS OWN UGLINESS WHICH OUTRAGESHIM MUST BE CONCEALED FROM EVERY EYE LEST IT SHOULD NOT BE RESPECTED ASZARATHUSTRA RESPECTED IT. IF THERE BE A GOD HE TOO MUST BE EVADED. HISPITY MUST BE FOILED. BUT GOD IS UBIQUITOUS AND OMNISCIENT. THEREFOREFOR THE REALLY GREAT UGLY MAN HE MUST NOT EXIST. THEIR PITY IS IT FROMWHICH I FLEE AWAY HE SAYSTHAT IS TO SAY IT IS FROM THEIR WANT OFREVERENCE AND LACK OF SHAME IN PRESENCE OF MY GREAT MISERY THE UGLIESTMAN DESPISES HIMSELF BUT ZARATHUSTRA SAID IN HIS PROLOGUE I LOVETHE GREAT DESPISERS BECAUSE THEY ARE THE GREAT ADORERS AND ARROWS OFLONGING FOR THE OTHER SHORE. HE THEREFORE HONOURS THE UGLIEST MAN SEESHEIGHT IN HIS SELFCONTEMPT AND INVITES HIM TO JOIN THE OTHER HIGHERMEN IN THE CAVE.CHAPTER LXVIII. THE VOLUNTARY BEGGAR.IN THIS DISCOURSE WE UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE THE IDEAL BUDDHIST IF NOTGAUTAMA BUDDHA HIMSELF. NIETZSCHE HAD THE GREATEST RESPECT FOR BUDDHISMAND ALMOST WHEREVER HE REFERS TO IT IN HIS WORKS IT IS IN TERMS OFPRAISE. HE RECOGNISED THAT THOUGH BUDDHISM IS UNDOUBTEDLY A RELIGION FORDECADENTS ITS DECADENT VALUES EMANATE FROM THE HIGHER AND NOT AS INCHRISTIANITY FROM THE LOWER GRADES OF SOCIETY. IN APHORISM OF THEANTICHRIST HE COMPARES IT EXHAUSTIVELY WITH CHRISTIANITY ANDTHE RESULT OF HIS INVESTIGATION IS VERY MUCH IN FAVOUR OF THE OLDERRELIGION. STILL HE RECOGNISED A MOST DECIDED BUDDHISTIC INFLUENCEIN CHRISTS TEACHING AND THE WORDS IN VERSES AND ARE VERYREMINISCENT OF HIS VIEWS IN REGARD TO THE CHRISTIAN SAVIOR.THE FIGURE OF CHRIST HAS BEEN INTRODUCED OFTEN ENOUGH INTO FICTION ANDMANY SCHOLARS HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO WRITE HIS LIFE ACCORDING TO THEIR OWNLIGHTS BUT FEW PERHAPS HAVE EVER ATTEMPTED TO PRESENT HIM TO US BEREFTOF ALL THOSE CHARACTERISTICS WHICH A LACK OF THE SENSE OF HARMONY HASATTACHED TO HIS PERSON THROUGH THE AGES IN WHICH HIS DOCTRINES HAVE BEENTAUGHT. NOW NIETZSCHE DISAGREED ENTIRELY WITH RENANS VIEW THAT CHRISTWAS LE GRAND MAITRE EN IRONIE IN APHORISM OF THE ANTICHRISTHE SAYS THAT HE NIETZSCHE ALWAYS PURGED HIS PICTURE OF THE HUMBLENAZARENE OF ALL THOSE BITTER AND SPITEFUL OUTBURSTS WHICH IN VIEW OFTHE STRUGGLE THE FIRST CHRISTIANS WENT THROUGH MAY VERY WELL HAVE BEENADDED TO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTER BY APOLOGISTS AND SECTARIANS WHO ATTHAT TIME COULD ILL AFFORD TO CONSIDER NICE PSYCHOLOGICAL POINTSSEEING THAT WHAT THEY NEEDED ABOVE ALL WAS A WRANGLING AND ABUSIVEDEITY. THESE TWO CONFLICTING HALVES IN THE CHARACTER OF THE CHRIST OFTHE GOSPELS WHICH NO SOUND PSYCHOLOGY CAN EVER RECONCILE NIETZSCHEALWAYS KEPT DISTINCT IN HIS OWN MIND HE COULD NOT CREDIT THE SAME MANWITH SENTIMENTS SOMETIMES SO NOBLE AND AT OTHER TIMES SO VULGAR ANDIN PRESENTING US WITH THIS NEW PORTRAIT OF THE SAVIOUR PURGED OF ALLIMPURITIES NIETZSCHE RENDERED MILITARY HONOURS TO A FOE WHICH FAREXCEED IN WORTH ALL THAT HIS MOST ARDENT DISCIPLES HAVE EVER CLAIMED FORHIM. IN VERSE WE ARE VIVIDLY REMINDED OF HERBERT SPENCERS WORDS LEMARIAGE DE CONVENANCE IS LEGALISED PROSTITUTION.CHAPTER LXIX. THE SHADOW.HERE WE HAVE A DESCRIPTION OF THAT COURAGEOUS AND WAYWARD SPIRIT THATLITERALLY HAUNTS THE FOOTSTEPS OF EVERY GREAT THINKER AND EVERY GREATLEADER SOMETIMES WITH THE RESULT THAT IT LOSES ALL AIMS ALL HOPESAND ALL TRUST IN A DEFINITE GOAL. IT IS THE CASE OF THE BRAVEST ANDMOST BROADMINDED MEN OF TODAY. THESE LITERALLY SHADOW THE MOST DARINGMOVEMENTS IN THE SCIENCE AND ART OF THEIR GENERATION THEY COMPLETELYLOSE THEIR BEARINGS AND ACTUALLY FIND THEMSELVES IN THE END WITHOUT AWAY A GOAL OR A HOME. ON EVERY SURFACE HAVE I ALREADY SAT...I BECOMETHIN I AM ALMOST EQUAL TO A SHADOW AT LAST IN DESPAIR SUCH MENDO INDEED CRY OUT NOTHING IS TRUE ALL IS PERMITTED AND THEN THEYBECOME MERE WRECKAGE. TOO MUCH HATH BECOME CLEAR UNTO ME NOW NOTHINGMATTERETH TO ME ANY MORE. NOTHING LIVETH ANY LONGER THAT I LOVEHOWSHOULD I STILL LOVE MYSELF HAVE I STILL A GOAL WHERE IS MY HOME ZARATHUSTRA REALISES THE DANGER THREATENING SUCH A MAN. THY DANGER ISNOT SMALL THOU FREE SPIRIT AND WANDERER HE SAYS. THOU HAST HAD A BADDAY. SEE THAT A STILL WORSE EVENING DOTH NOT OVERTAKE THEE THE DANGERZARATHUSTRA REFERS TO IS PRECISELY THIS THAT EVEN A PRISON MAY SEEM ABLESSING TO SUCH A MAN. AT LEAST THE BARS KEEP HIM IN A PLACE OF RESTA PLACE OF CONFINEMENT AT ITS WORST IS REAL. BEWARE LEST IN THE ENDA NARROW FAITH CAPTURE THEE SAYS ZARATHUSTRA FOR NOW EVERYTHING THATIS NARROW AND FIXED SEDUCETH AND TEMPTETH THEE.CHAPTER LXX. NOONTIDE.AT THE NOON OF LIFE NIETZSCHE SAID HE ENTERED THE WORLD WITH HIMMAN CAME OF AGE. WE ARE NOW HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ACTIONS OUR OLDGUARDIANS THE GODS AND DEMIGODS OF OUR YOUTH THE SUPERSTITIONS ANDFEARS OF OUR CHILDHOOD WITHDRAW THE FIELD LIES OPEN BEFORE US WELIVED THROUGH OUR MORNING WITH BUT ONE MASTERCHANCE LET US SEE TOIT THAT WE MAKE OUR AFTERNOON OUR OWN SEE NOTE XLIX. PART III..CHAPTER LXXI. THE GREETING.HERE I THINK I MAY CLAIM THAT MY CONTENTION IN REGARD TO THE PURPOSE ANDAIM OF THE WHOLE OF NIETZSCHES PHILOSOPHY AS STATED AT THE BEGINNINGOF MY NOTES ON PART IV. IS COMPLETELY UPHELD. HE FOUGHT FOR ALL WHODO NOT WANT TO LIVE UNLESS THEY LEARN AGAIN TO HOPEUNLESS THEY LEARNFROM HIM THE GREAT HOPE ZARATHUSTRAS ADDRESS TO HIS GUESTS SHOWSCLEARLY ENOUGH HOW HE WISHED TO HELP THEM I DO NOT TREAT MY WARRIORSINDULGENTLY HE SAYS HOW THEN COULD YE BE FIT FOR MY WARFARE HEREBUKES AND SPURNS THEM NO WORD OF LOVE COMES FROM HIS LIPS. ELSEWHEREHE SAYS A MAN SHOULD BE A HARD BED TO HIS FRIEND THUS ALONE CAN HE BEOF USE TO HIM. NIETZSCHE WOULD BE A HARD BED TO HIGHER MEN. HE WOULDMAKE THEM HARDER FOR IN ORDER TO BE A LAW UNTO HIMSELF MAN MUSTPOSSESS THE REQUISITE HARDNESS. I WAIT FOR HIGHER ONES STRONGER ONESMORE TRIUMPHANT ONES MERRIER ONES FOR SUCH AS ARE BUILT SQUARELY INBODY AND SOUL. HE SAYS IN PAR. OF HIGHER MANYE HIGHER MEN THINK YE THAT I AM HERE TO PUT RIGHT WHAT YE HAVE PUTWRONG OR THAT I WISHED HENCEFORTH TO MAKE SNUGGER COUCHES FOR YOUSUFFERERS OR SHOW YOU RESTLESS MISWANDERING MISCLIMBING ONES NEW ANDEASIER FOOTPATHSNAY NAY THREE TIMES NAY ALWAYS MORE ALWAYS BETTER ONES OF YOUR TYPESHALL SUCCUMBFOR YE SHALL ALWAYS HAVE IT WORSE AND HARDER.CHAPTER LXXII. THE SUPPER.IN THE FIRST SEVEN VERSES OF THIS DISCOURSE I CANNOT HELP SEEINGA GENTLE ALLUSION TO SCHOPENHAUERS HABITS AS A BONVIVANT. FOR APESSIMIST BE IT REMEMBERED SCHOPENHAUER LED QUITE AN EXTRAORDINARYLIFE. HE ATE WELL LOVED WELL PLAYED THE FLUTE WELL AND I BELIEVE HESMOKED THE BEST CIGARS. WHAT FOLLOWS IS CLEAR ENOUGH.CHAPTER LXXIII. THE HIGHER MAN. PAR. .NIETZSCHE ADMITS HERE THAT AT ONE TIME HE HAD THOUGHT OF APPEALING TOTHE PEOPLE TO THE CROWD IN THE MARKETPLACE BUT THAT HE HAD ULTIMATELYTO ABANDON THE TASK. HE BIDS HIGHER MEN DEPART FROM THE MARKETPLACE.PAR. .HERE WE ARE TOLD QUITE PLAINLY WHAT CLASS OF MEN ACTUALLY OWE ALL THEIRIMPULSES AND DESIRES TO THE INSTINCT OF SELFPRESERVATION. THE STRUGGLEFOR EXISTENCE IS INDEED THE ONLY SPUR IN THE CASE OF SUCH PEOPLE.TO THEM IT MATTERS NOT IN WHAT SHAPE OR CONDITION MAN BE PRESERVEDPROVIDED ONLY HE SURVIVE. THE TRANSCENDENTAL MAXIM THAT LIFE PER SE ISPRECIOUS IS THE RULING MAXIM HERE.PAR. .IN THE NOTE ON CHAPTER LVII. END I SPEAK OF NIETZSCHES ELEVATION OFTHE VIRTUE COURAGE TO THE HIGHEST PLACE AMONG THE VIRTUES. HERE HETELLS HIGHER MEN THE CLASS OF COURAGE HE EXPECTS FROM THEM.PARS. .THESE HAVE ALREADY BEEN REFERRED TO IN THE NOTES ON CHAPTERS LVII. ENDAND LXXI.PAR. .I SUGGEST THAT THE LAST VERSE IN THIS PARAGRAPH STRONGLY CONFIRMS THEVIEW THAT NIETZSCHES TEACHING WAS ALWAYS MEANT BY HIM TO BE ESOTERICAND FOR HIGHER MAN ALONE.PAR. .IN THE LAST VERSE HERE ANOTHER SHAFT OF LIGHT IS THROWN UPON THEIMMACULATE PERCEPTION OR SOCALLED PURE OBJECTIVITY OF THE SCIENTIFICMIND. FREEDOM FROM FEVER IS STILL FAR FROM BEING KNOWLEDGE. WHERE AMANS EMOTIONS CEASE TO ACCOMPANY HIM IN HIS INVESTIGATIONS HE ISNOT NECESSARILY NEARER THE TRUTH. SAYS SPENCER IN THE PREFACE TO HISAUTOBIOGRAPHYIN THE GENESIS OF A SYSTEM OF THOUGHT THE EMOTIONALNATURE IS A LARGE FACTOR PERHAPS AS LARGE A FACTOR AS THE INTELLECTUALNATURE SEE PAGES OF VOL. I. THOUGHTS OUT OF SEASON.PARS. .WHEN WE APPROACH NIETZSCHES PHILOSOPHY WE MUST BE PREPARED TO BEINDEPENDENT THINKERS IN FACT THE GREATEST VIRTUE OF HIS WORKS ISPERHAPS THE SUBTLETY WITH WHICH THEY IMPOSE THE OBLIGATION UPON ONEOF THINKING ALONE OF SCORING OFF ONES OWN BAT AND OF SHIFTINGINTELLECTUALLY FOR ONESELF.PAR. .I AM A RAILING ALONGSIDE THE TORRENT WHOEVER IS ABLE TO GRASP ME MAYGRASP ME YOUR CRUTCH HOWEVER I AM NOT. THESE TWO PARAGRAPHS ARE ANEXHORTATION TO HIGHER MEN TO BECOME INDEPENDENT.PAR. .HERE NIETZSCHE PERHAPS EXAGGERATES THE IMPORTANCE OF HEREDITY. ASHOWEVER THE QUESTION IS BY NO MEANS ONE ON WHICH WE ARE ALL AGREEDWHAT HE SAYS IS NOT WITHOUT VALUE.A VERY IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE IN NIETZSCHES PHILOSOPHY IS ENUNCIATED INTHE FIRST VERSE OF THIS PARAGRAPH. THE HIGHER ITS TYPE ALWAYS THESELDOMER DOTH A THING SUCCEED SEE PAGE OF BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL.THOSE WHO LIKE SOME POLITICAL ECONOMISTS TALK IN A BUSINESSLIKE WAYABOUT THE TERRIFIC WASTE OF HUMAN LIFE AND ENERGY DELIBERATELY OVERLOOKTHE FACT THAT THE WASTE MOST TO BE DEPLORED USUALLY OCCURS AMONGHIGHER INDIVIDUALS. ECONOMY WAS NEVER PRECISELY ONE OF NATURES LEADINGPRINCIPLES. ALL THIS SENTIMENTAL WAILING OVER THE LARGER PROPORTIONOF FAILURES THAN SUCCESSES IN HUMAN LIFE DOES NOT SEEM TO TAKE INTOACCOUNT THE FACT THAT IT IS THE RAREST THING ON EARTH FOR A HIGHLYORGANISED BEING TO ATTAIN TO THE FULLEST DEVELOPMENT AND ACTIVITY OF ALLITS FUNCTIONS SIMPLY BECAUSE IT IS SO HIGHLY ORGANISED. THE BLIND WILLTO POWER IN NATURE THEREFORE STANDS IN URGENT NEED OF DIRECTION BY MAN.PARS. .THESE PARAGRAPHS DEAL WITH NIETZSCHES PROTEST AGAINST THE DEMOCRATICSERIOUSNESS POBELERNST OF MODERN TIMES. ALL GOOD THINGS LAUGH HESAYS AND HIS FINAL COMMAND TO THE HIGHER MEN IS LEARN I PRAY YOUTOLAUGH. ALL THAT IS GOOD IN NIETZSCHES SENSE IS CHEERFUL. TO BE ABLETO CRACK A JOKE ABOUT ONES DEEPEST FEELINGS IS THE GREATEST TEST OFTHEIR VALUE. THE MAN WHO DOES NOT LAUGH LIKE THE MAN WHO DOES NOT MAKEFACES IS ALREADY A BUFFOON AT HEART.WHAT HATH HITHERTO BEEN THE GREATEST SIN HERE ON EARTH WAS IT NOT THEWORD OF HIM WHO SAID WOE UNTO THEM THAT LAUGH NOW DID HE HIMSELFFIND NO CAUSE FOR LAUGHTER ON THE EARTH THEN HE SOUGHT BADLY. A CHILDEVEN FINDETH CAUSE FOR IT.CHAPTER LXXIV. THE SONG OF MELANCHOLY.AFTER HIS ADDRESS TO THE HIGHER MEN ZARATHUSTRA GOES OUT INTO THEOPEN TO RECOVER HIMSELF. MEANWHILE THE MAGICIAN WAGNER SEIZING THEOPPORTUNITY IN ORDER TO DRAW THEM ALL INTO HIS NET ONCE MORE SINGS THESONG OF MELANCHOLY.CHAPTER LXXV. SCIENCE.THE ONLY ONE TO RESIST THE MELANCHOLY VOLUPTUOUSNESS OF HIS ART ISTHE SPIRITUALLY CONSCIENTIOUS ONETHE SCIENTIFIC SPECIALIST OF WHOM WEREAD IN THE DISCOURSE ENTITLED THE LEECH. HE TAKES THE HARP FROM THEMAGICIAN AND CRIES FOR AIR WHILE REPROVING THE MUSICIAN IN THE STYLEOF THE CASE OF WAGNER. WHEN THE MAGICIAN RETALIATES BY SAYING THAT THESPIRITUALLY CONSCIENTIOUS ONE COULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD LITTLE OF HIS SONGTHE LATTER REPLIES THOU PRAISEST ME IN THAT THOU SEPARATEST ME FROMTHYSELF. THE SPEECH OF THE SCIENTIFIC MAN TO HIS FELLOW HIGHER MEN ISWELL WORTH STUDYING. BY MEANS OF IT NIETZSCHE PAYS A HIGH TRIBUTE TOTHE HONESTY OF THE TRUE SPECIALIST WHILE IN REPRESENTING HIM AS THEONLY ONE WHO CAN RESIST THE DEMONIACAL INFLUENCE OF THE MAGICIANSMUSIC HE ELEVATES HIM AT A STROKE ABOVE ALL THOSE PRESENT. ZARATHUSTRAAND THE SPIRITUALLY CONSCIENTIOUS ONE JOIN ISSUE AT THE END ON THEQUESTION OF THE PROPER PLACE OF FEAR IN MANS HISTORY AND NIETZSCHEAVAILS HIMSELF OF THE OPPORTUNITY IN ORDER TO RESTATE HIS VIEWSCONCERNING THE RELATION OF COURAGE TO HUMANITY. IT IS PRECISELY BECAUSECOURAGE HAS PLAYED THE MOST IMPORTANT PART IN OUR DEVELOPMENT THATHE WOULD NOT SEE IT VANISH FROM AMONG OUR VIRTUES TODAY. ...COURAGESEEMETH TO ME THE ENTIRE PRIMITIVE HISTORY OF MAN.CHAPTER LXXVI. AMONG THE DAUGHTERS OF THE DESERT.THIS TELLS ITS OWN TALE.CHAPTER LXXVII. THE AWAKENING.IN THIS DISCOURSE NIETZSCHE WISHES TO GIVE HIS FOLLOWERS A WARNING.HE THINKS HE HAS SO FAR HELPED THEM THAT THEY HAVE BECOME CONVALESCENTTHAT NEW DESIRES ARE AWAKENED IN THEM AND THAT NEW HOPES ARE IN THEIRARMS AND LEGS. BUT HE MISTAKES THE NATURE OF THE CHANGE. TRUE HE HASHELPED THEM HE HAS GIVEN THEM BACK WHAT THEY MOST NEED I.E. BELIEF INBELIEVINGTHE CONFIDENCE IN HAVING CONFIDENCE IN SOMETHING BUT HOWDO THEY USE IT THIS BELIEF IN FAITH IF ONE CAN SO EXPRESS IT WITHOUTSEEMING TAUTOLOGICAL HAS CERTAINLY BEEN RESTORED TO THEM AND INTHE FIRST FLOOD OF THEIR ENTHUSIASM THEY USE IT BY BOWING DOWN ANDWORSHIPPING AN ASS WHEN WRITING THIS PASSAGE NIETZSCHE WAS OBVIOUSLYTHINKING OF THE ACCUSATIONS WHICH WERE LEVELLED AT THE EARLY CHRISTIANSBY THEIR PAGAN CONTEMPORARIES. IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THEY WERE SUPPOSEDNOT ONLY TO BE EATERS OF HUMAN FLESH BUT ALSO ASSWORSHIPPERS AND AMONGTHE ROMAN GRAFFITI THE MOST FAMOUS IS THE ONE FOUND ON THE PALATINOSHOWING A MAN WORSHIPPING A CROSS ON WHICH IS SUSPENDED A FIGUREWITH THE HEAD OF AN ASS SEE MINUCIUS FELIX OCTAVIUS IX. TACITUSHISTORIAE V. TERTULLIAN APOLOGIA ETC.. NIETZSCHES OBVIOUSMORAL HOWEVER IS THAT GREAT SCIENTISTS AND THINKERS ONCE THEY HAVEREACHED THE WALL ENCIRCLING SCEPTICISM AND HAVE THEREBY LEARNED TORECOVER THEIR CONFIDENCE IN THE ACT OF BELIEVING AS SUCH USUALLYMANIFEST THE CHANGE IN THEIR OUTLOOK BY FALLING VICTIMS TO THE NARROWESTAND MOST SUPERSTITIOUS OF CREEDS. SO MUCH FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF THEASS AS AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP.NOW WITH REGARD TO THE ACTUAL SERVICE AND ASSFESTIVAL NO READER WHOHAPPENS TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH THE RELIGIOUS HISTORY OF THE MIDDLE AGESWILL FAIL TO SEE THE ALLUSION HERE TO THE ASINARIA FESTA WHICH WERE BYNO MEANS UNCOMMON IN FRANCE GERMANY AND ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE DURING THETHIRTEENTH FOURTEENTH AND FIFTEENTH CENTURIES.CHAPTER LXXVIII. THE ASSFESTIVAL.AT LENGTH IN THE MIDDLE OF THEIR FEAST ZARATHUSTRA BURSTS IN UPONTHEM AND REBUKES THEM SOUNDLY. BUT HE DOES NOT DO SO LONG IN THEASSFESTIVAL IT SUDDENLY OCCURS TO HIM THAT HE IS CONCERNED WITH ACEREMONY THAT MAY NOT BE WITHOUT ITS PURPOSE AS SOMETHING FOOLISH BUTNECESSARYA RECREATION FOR WISE MEN. HE IS THEREFORE HIGHLY PLEASEDTHAT THE HIGHER MEN HAVE ALL BLOSSOMED FORTH THEY THEREFORE REQUIRENEW FESTIVALSA LITTLE VALIANT NONSENSE SOME DIVINE SERVICE ANDASSFESTIVAL SOME OLD JOYFUL ZARATHUSTRA FOOL SOME BLUSTERER TO BLOWTHEIR SOULS BRIGHT.HE TELLS THEM NOT TO FORGET THAT NIGHT AND THE ASSFESTIVAL FOR SUCHTHINGS ONLY THE CONVALESCENT DEVISE AND SHOULD YE CELEBRATE IT AGAIN HE CONCLUDES DO IT FROM LOVE TO YOURSELVES DO IT ALSO FROM LOVE TOME AND IN REMEMBRANCE OF MECHAPTER LXXIX. THE DRUNKEN SONG.IT WERE THE HEIGHT OF PRESUMPTION TO ATTEMPT TO FIX ANY PARTICULARINTERPRETATION OF MY OWN TO THE WORDS OF THIS SONG. WITH WHAT HAS GONEBEFORE THE READER WHILE READING IT AS POETRY SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEEKAND FIND HIS OWN MEANING IN IT. THE DOCTRINE OF THE ETERNAL RECURRENCEAPPEARS FOR THE LAST TIME HERE IN AN ARTFORM. NIETZSCHE LAYS STRESSUPON THE FACT THAT ALL HAPPINESS ALL DELIGHT LONGS FOR REPETITIONSAND JUST AS A CHILD CRIES AGAIN AGAIN TO THE ADULT WHO HAPPENS TOBE AMUSING HIM SO THE MAN WHO SEES A MEANING AND A JOYFUL MEANING INEXISTENCE MUST ALSO CRY AGAIN AND YET AGAIN TO ALL HIS LIFE.CHAPTER LXXX. THE SIGN.IN THIS DISCOURSE NIETZSCHE DISASSOCIATES HIMSELF FINALLY FROM THEHIGHER MEN AND BY THE SYMBOL OF THE LION WISHES TO CONVEY TO US THATHE HAS WON OVER AND MASTERED THE BEST AND THE MOST TERRIBLE IN NATURE.THAT GREAT POWER AND TENDERNESS ARE KIN WAS ALREADY HIS BELIEF INEIGHT YEARS BEFORE HE WROTE THIS SPEECH AND WHEN THE BIRDS ANDTHE LION COME TO HIM IT IS BECAUSE HE IS THE EMBODIMENT OF THE TWOQUALITIES. ALL THAT IS TERRIBLE AND GREAT IN NATURE THE HIGHER MEN ARENOT YET PREPARED FOR FOR THEY RETREAT HORRORSTRICKEN INTO THE CAVEWHEN THE LION SPRINGS AT THEM BUT ZARATHUSTRA MAKES NOT A MOVE TOWARDSTHEM.
